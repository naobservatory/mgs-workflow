# Trivy CVE triage

HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities in any container image pinned in `configs/containers.config` that aren't already in `.trivyignore` need triage. They surface two ways: the `scan-containers` CI job failing on a PR, or a PR-less scan of `dev` finding CVEs with no source PR. This skill triages either. The PR-less path lets the skill be invoked without a PR by an automated caller (e.g. a scheduled CI job).

**Default agent behavior on Trivy failures has historically been "add to `.trivyignore` and move on" — that's the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.** Each step below asks for evidence; record what you find as you go, because the final PR-description block has to surface the assessment to a reviewer.

## When to use

- `scan-containers` CI job failing on a PR.
- A PR-less scan of `dev` found HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs (no source PR) — e.g. an automated scheduled CI job.
- A reviewer asks for a Trivy follow-up.
- You're updating a container yml and want to confirm no new HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs slip through.

## Inputs

`pr_number` selects the mode (resolved in **Mode & setup**); all inputs are optional.

- `pr_number` (optional): the number of a PR whose `scan-containers` job is failing. Set → **PR mode** (triage that PR's scan). Absent → **scheduled mode** (triage a fresh scan of the current `dev` HEAD, with no source PR — this is how an automated caller such as a scheduled CI job invokes the skill).
- `scan_results_dir` (optional): path to a directory of Trivy JSON results the caller already produced (e.g. a scheduled CI job's scan step). When set, it is used as the scan results directory directly.
- `local_scan` (optional): if `true`, additionally run Trivy locally against the containers (useful when CI is broken or you want to scan against a `.trivyignore` you haven't pushed yet). Requires the `trivy` binary + Docker.

## Mode & setup

The skill runs in one of two modes, distinguished by whether `pr_number` is given. **This is the only place the two modes differ.** It resolves two things — the **working branch** and the **scan results directory** — and every step after it is mode-agnostic, referring only to those two.

### Resolve the working branch

**Default (both modes): branch off `dev`; the triage lands in its own separate PR.**

```bash
git fetch origin dev --quiet
git checkout -b coding-agent/trivy-triage-YYYY-MM-DD origin/dev
```

Most `scan-containers` failures surface global-state CVEs (libcap2, libgnutls30, Go-stdlib, etc.) that have no causal link to any one PR's actual changes; piling security patches onto an unrelated PR conflates reviewer concerns. Use a failing PR's CI output as the *input* to the triage; deliver the fix separately.

**PR-mode exception:** if the triage (Step 2) finds that the failing PR's *own diff* introduced the CVE (a new yml pin in its diff), the fix belongs inline on that PR — use the failing PR's branch as the working branch, and append the assessment block to that existing PR under a `# Trivy triage` heading rather than opening a new one. When in doubt, ask. In scheduled mode there is no source PR, so this exception never applies: always the coding-agent branch off `dev`.

Everything below calls this **the working branch**, and the PR it produces **the triage PR** — a new PR by default, or the failing PR under the exception above.

### Resolve the scan results directory

You need a directory of per-container Trivy JSON: one `<container>.json` per scanned image plus an aggregated `summary.json`. The per-container JSON is the Trivy raw output; vulnerabilities live at `Results[].Vulnerabilities[]`.

- **PR mode** (`pr_number` set): download the failing PR's latest *completed* `scan-containers` artifact.

  ```bash
  # Resolve the PR's branch from the PR number, then find the latest *completed* run ID.
  # (Without --status completed you may grab an in-progress run that has no artifact yet.)
  BRANCH=$(gh pr view <pr_number> --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
  gh run list --workflow=trivy-scan.yml --branch "$BRANCH" --status completed --limit 1 --json databaseId,headSha,conclusion
  # Then download the trivy-scan-results artifact:
  gh run download <RUN_ID> -n trivy-scan-results -D /tmp/trivy
  ```

- **Scheduled mode** (no `pr_number`): if the caller passed `scan_results_dir`, use that directory of Trivy JSON as-is. Otherwise run the scan directly against the dev container set:

  ```bash
  python bin/scan_containers.py --config configs/containers.config --output-dir /tmp/trivy
  ```

If `local_scan=true` (or CI is broken, or you want to scan against a `.trivyignore` you haven't pushed yet), run the scan locally to produce the directory. Requires the `trivy` binary + Docker:

```bash
python bin/scan_containers.py --config configs/containers.config --output-dir /tmp/trivy
```

This pulls each container, runs Trivy with the current `.trivyignore`, and writes JSON results to `/tmp/trivy/`. **Note: it scans the containers in your *current branch's* `configs/containers.config`.** You're on the working branch (off `dev`) at this point, so the local scan reflects the dev container set — usually fine, since most `scan-containers` failures are global-state CVEs that apply identically across branches. If the failing PR has yml or `configs/containers.config` changes in its diff, check out that branch first (or copy the relevant files in) before running the local scan. (In scheduled mode you already run `scan_containers.py`, so `local_scan` adds nothing there.)

Also note the **scan origin** for the PR body (Step 4): in PR mode, `PR #<n>`; in scheduled mode, "the scheduled scan on `dev`". Don't imply a source PR when there isn't one.

Everything below calls the resolved directory **the scan results directory** (`/tmp/trivy` in the examples).

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Extract the actionable CVE list

For each per-container JSON in the scan results directory, extract HIGH + CRITICAL vulnerabilities that aren't already in `.trivyignore`. A one-liner:

```bash
jq -r '.Results[]? | .Type as $type | .Vulnerabilities[]? |
       select(.Severity == "HIGH" or .Severity == "CRITICAL") |
       [.VulnerabilityID, .Severity, .PkgName, .InstalledVersion, .FixedVersion // "n/a",
        $type, .PkgPath // "", .Title // ""] | @tsv' \
   /tmp/trivy/<container>.json
```

`.Type` tells you which packaging ecosystem the vulnerable code lives in, which determines where a fix can come from:

- `python-pkg` → conda env site-packages: fix lands in a `containers/*.yml` pin (direct or transitive — see §2d).
- `debian` → system apt: a fix usually requires a base-image bump rather than a yml edit (Debian stable rarely backports CVE fixes into the running release; status `<no-dsa>` is the common dead end).
- `gobinary` → a statically-linked Go binary shipped by an upstream conda package: the fix has to come from that upstream rebuilding against a newer Go toolchain. The yml can only switch to a fixed upstream release if one exists (often it doesn't — Escalate).

`Type` is a property of the enclosing `Results[]` entry, not of the vulnerability — read it off the result, as above, or every row comes back null. `PkgPath` (e.g. `opt/conda/.../site-packages/...` or `usr/bin/<name>`) says where the vulnerable code sits; an empty one on a language-ecosystem row is a signal in its own right, see §2b.

Cross-reference each ID against `.trivyignore` and drop any that are already listed. Note `.trivyignore` carries both `CVE-*` and `GHSA-*` IDs (e.g. `GHSA-82j2-j2ch-gfr8` for Rust crates without a NVD entry), so match both:

```bash
grep -oE "CVE-[0-9]+-[0-9]+|GHSA-[a-z0-9-]+" .trivyignore | sort -u > /tmp/already-ignored.txt
```

If the scan still reports an ID that's in `.trivyignore`, the existing ignore is stale (expired or otherwise non-matching) — flag it and treat as fresh.

**Count distinct vulnerability IDs, not findings.** Trivy emits one finding per affected package per image, so a handful of IDs can present as hundreds of findings. Deduplicate across the results directory before sizing the triage, and quote distinct-ID counts in the PR body — but keep the per-package, per-container occurrences, because one ID can need a different action in each container (see the mixed-outcomes worked example in step 4):

```bash
jq -r '.Results[]?.Vulnerabilities[]? | select(.Severity == "HIGH" or .Severity == "CRITICAL") | .VulnerabilityID' \
   /tmp/trivy/*.json | sort -u
```

### Step 2 — For each CVE: gather facts before deciding

**Do this per CVE. Do not batch.** Each distinct CVE gets its own structured assessment. Run the per-CVE blocks inline, or dispatch each one to a sub-agent (good when there are many findings, to keep each context focused) — either is fine, but don't collapse multiple CVEs into a single shared assessment.

**2a. Read the CVE.** Visit `PrimaryURL` (usually NVD or the distro tracker) and read enough to understand:
- What kind of vulnerability is it? (RCE, DoS, information disclosure, privilege escalation, …)
- What component of the package is affected? (a specific function, a config option, a code path)
- What does an attacker need to trigger it? (network access, local user, malformed input, specific config)

**2b. Identify the affected package's role in our containers.** Which container(s) include it? Is it pulled in directly (in the container's conda env / apt install) or transitively (as a dep of something else)?

The Trivy JSON's `Results[].Vulnerabilities[].PkgPath` is the most useful forensic field — e.g. `opt/conda/lib/python3.13/site-packages/urllib3-...` tells you the package is in a conda env (and which env), inside a wheel, or system-level.

To inspect a published container interactively (pull it, drop into a shell, verify package versions):

```bash
# The image tag lives in configs/containers.config — grab it directly:
TAG=$(grep -E "^\s*<container_name>\s*=" configs/containers.config | sed -E 's/.*"(.*)".*/\1/')
docker pull "$TAG"
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint bash "$TAG"
# Inside the container:
#   apt-cache policy <pkg>        # apt-side installed + candidate version
#   micromamba list <pkg>         # conda-side installed version
#   pip show <pkg>                # python-pkg-side
#   strings $(which <bin>) | grep '^go1\.'    # Go stdlib version in a gobinary
```

**A language-ecosystem finding with no `PkgPath` means the package wasn't installed in its own right — not that it's absent from the image. Find where the code actually lives before you pin anything.**

This applies only to language ecosystems — results whose `Type` is `python-pkg`, `node-pkg`, `jar`, and so on. OS-package results (`Type` of `debian`, `ubuntu`, `alpine`) never carry a `PkgPath`, and that's normal; don't read anything into it.

The usual source is a bundled dependency. pip ships the libraries it vendors under `site-packages/pip/_vendor/`, along with a manifest (`vendor.txt`, `bom.cdx.json`) that Trivy reads as packages in their own right. One image can therefore report the same package twice: the conda copy, with a `PkgPath`, and the bundled copy, without one. **The bundled code is genuinely in the image** — so pinning the top-level package in the yml installs a second, separate copy next to it, leaves the bundled one untouched, and doesn't clear the finding.

Ask Trivy where each copy came from, then confirm on the filesystem:

```bash
trivy image --format json --list-all-pkgs "$TAG" |
  jq -r '.Results[].Packages[]? | select(.Name == "<pkg>") |
         [.Version, .AnalyzedBy, .FilePath // "none"] | @tsv'
# In the container: micromamba list <pkg>; ls /opt/conda/lib/python*/site-packages | grep -i <pkg>
# And for a bundled copy:  ls /opt/conda/lib/python*/site-packages/pip/_vendor/
```

No `conda-meta` entry and no `dist-info` directory means nothing installed it directly, so the fix has to come through whatever bundles it: check whether that package has a release which re-vendors a fixed version, and whether the release is reachable from the yml (often it isn't — pip's newest release can still vendor the vulnerable version). If no reachable fix exists, this is the ordinary no-fix case; take it through the reachability assessment in 2c and the Ignore/Escalate criteria in 2e like any other. See anti-pattern #5.

**2c. Assess whether the pipeline reaches the vulnerable functionality.** The load-bearing step. Don't dismiss based on "the container is isolated"; name what the pipeline actually does with this package:

- Does the pipeline invoke the affected functionality? (Read the Nextflow process scripts, `bin/` scripts, container entrypoints.)
- Is the attack vector reachable? (A network-protocol DoS doesn't apply if the binary never opens a socket; a malformed-input bug applies if we feed it arbitrary user data.)

Write the conclusion concretely — "BBDuk parses FASTQ via X; the CVE affects Y; we don't use Y because Z" or "reachable; here's how."

**2d. Search for a fix, and identify the concrete yml edit each fix-source implies.** Each source dictates a different kind of yml change in step 3a:

- **Distro update** → no yml edit; pull the next container rebuild. `apt-cache policy <pkg>` inside the container, or check the Debian/Alpine security tracker. Rarely fires for stable Debian since CVEs are usually marked `<no-dsa>` rather than backported.
- **Base-image bump** (e.g. Debian bookworm → trixie) → change the base-image config knob in `pyproject.toml` (single source of truth; see `get_base_image()` in `bin/build_ecr_container.py`). Often the right answer when "no fix in our current Debian version" is reported. **This affects every container — flag it explicitly in the PR body.**
- **Upstream conda package** → bump the existing yml pin to a fixed version, or, for the common "fix exists upstream but a feedstock pins it out of reach" pattern (urllib3 inside awscli, quinn-proto inside Polars), add an *explicit* pin for the transitive dep so the spec hash changes and the build picks up the fixed build (see step 3a). `conda search -c <channel> <pkg>` lists versions when conda is installed (check `command -v conda` first). Otherwise the anaconda.org REST API works and critically also shows what each version's deps pin:

  ```bash
  curl -s "https://api.anaconda.org/release/conda-forge/<pkg>/<version>" |
    jq '.distributions[0].attrs.depends[] | select(test("<dep_pattern>"))'
  ```
- **Upstream tool update** → bump the tool's pin in its container yml (e.g. `multiqc=1.30 → 1.31` pulls in patched deps). Check the tool's changelog first to flag any potentially breaking changes in the PR body.
- **Workaround at config level** → no yml edit; the workaround lives in the pipeline code (Nextflow process, `bin/` script). Rare; usually means Escalate so the user can decide whether the workaround is worth the complexity.

**2e. Decide.** Three legitimate outcomes:

| Outcome | When | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Patch** | A fix is available and applying it is safe | Update the container yml / pin version / bump base image, commit, push, and open the PR with a rebuild-handoff callout in the body (the agent role on this sandbox is ECR pull-only; the user finalizes the rebuild). Go to step 3a. |
| **Ignore** | No fix is available *and* the vulnerability is unreachable or has negligible impact in our context | Add to `.trivyignore` with detailed reasoning. Go to step 3b. |
| **Escalate** | Fix unavailable *and* the vulnerability is reachable, *or* you can't unambiguously assess reachability | Surface to the user. Don't suppress. |

Patterns that **do not** justify ignoring on their own:

- "No Debian fix available." Check whether a base-image bump or conda update exists. Only after that.
- "Not exploited in production." This isn't evidence; it's the absence of evidence. Assess the attack surface, don't rely on past silence.
- "The container is isolated." Many containers run network-facing tools or process untrusted data. Don't dismiss without naming the specific isolation.
- "Out of scope for this PR." If you're triaging Trivy, the assessment is the scope.

### Step 3 — Apply the action

**3a. Patch — yml edit, then open the PR with the rebuild-handoff callout in the body.** Edit the container yml (under `containers/`) to apply the fix:

- If the fix is in a direct dep, change the pin in the yml.
- **If the fix is in a transitive dep, add an explicit pin for the fix package itself in the yml.** This encodes the security intent *and* changes the spec hash that `bin/build_ecr_container.py` keys off (`compute_spec_hash`). Without a spec-hash change, the build script will skip the container even when the upstream conda package has shipped a fixed version — so a transitive bump that doesn't touch the yml will silently fail to rebuild.
- **Use exact pins, not ranges.**
- **Check what the version you're bumping to vendors.** A package that bundles its dependencies can clear the target CVE and bring in new ones through the candidate release's own `_vendor/` bundle. Inspect the candidate's vendored versions as you pick it — Step 5's full-image scan is the backstop, not the first line of defence.
- **Keep any inline yml comment to one line** naming the CVE IDs and the fix version. Detailed rationale belongs in the PR body, not the yml.

**Permitted edits:** add explicit pins (direct or transitive), tighten an existing range to a fixed version, bump the base-image config knob in `pyproject.toml`.

**Not permitted** (Escalate if a fix seems to need one of these): removing existing pinned deps (they're pinned for replication or compatibility reasons that aren't visible from the yml), editing the Dockerfile-generation code in `bin/build_ecr_container.py`, switching the base distro family (e.g. Debian → Alpine), or changing the conda channel list / channel-priority semantics.

Commit with the CVE ID in the message, push the branch, and open the PR as a draft per CLAUDE.md's PR conventions. **The PR body must include the rebuild-handoff callout (see Step 4) at the top**, because:

- The agent role on this sandbox is ECR pull-only and cannot publish images. The yml change does not itself clear the CVE on `scan-containers`: that CI job scans the *published* image tag pinned in `configs/containers.config`, and the new yml only takes effect once the container is rebuilt, pushed to ECR, and the tag re-pinned.
- The PR is the persistent rendezvous between agent and user. Agents that ran in subagent sessions may not be reachable later; pinning the handoff to the PR body means the user can finalize without needing the original agent back.

The PR opens with `scan-containers` red — expected, the callout explains why. The user runs the rebuild, pushes, watches CI go green, deletes the callout, and marks the PR ready for review; no agent re-invocation needed.

Do **not** add a `.trivyignore` entry for a fixable CVE to "cover the rebuild gap" — anti-pattern #1.

Ignore-outcome entries from the same triage can land on the same branch and PR — only the Patch side blocks merge until rebuild.

**3b. Add to `.trivyignore`.** Match the tightness of existing entries — typically a short header for grouped CVEs plus 4–8 comment lines total covering the four pieces below. Don't pad; if a piece is obvious from the rest, drop it.

```
# <one-line description of the vulnerability>
# <a few lines: which package, which functionality is affected, the
#  reachability conclusion from §2c (why our pipeline doesn't hit the
#  vulnerable code path, or what bounds the impact if it does),
#  what's blocking a fix, what would trigger re-evaluation>
CVE-XXXX-XXXXX exp:YYYY-MM-DD
```

Pick `exp:` ~6-12 weeks out, aligned with a realistic fix arrival (upstream release cadence + buffer). No expiries beyond a year — "this will never have a fix" is an Escalate, not an Ignore.

The existing `.trivyignore` skews toward a single batch re-eval date (e.g. `2026-06-30`) used across many entries. Per-entry dates tied to a specific release cadence are more useful when the trigger is well-defined (e.g. "awscli feedstock relaxes urllib3 cap"); batch dates are reasonable when the trigger is opaque and re-eval is best done as a periodic chore. Either pattern is acceptable; pick the one that gives the next triage agent the most useful signal.

If multiple related CVEs share an assessment (e.g. several Go-stdlib CVEs in the same statically-linked binary), group them under one comment block.

### Step 4 — Generate the PR description

The PR body has two parts: a temporary rebuild-handoff callout at the top (only when there's at least one Patch outcome), and the persistent Trivy-triage assessment block. Use this as the body of the triage PR resolved in **Mode & setup** — a fresh triage PR by default, or (under the PR-local exception) the assessment block appended to the failing PR under a `# Trivy triage` heading.

`<origin>` in the block below is the **scan origin** noted in **Mode & setup**: `PR #<n>` or "the scheduled scan on `dev`" — do not imply a source PR when there isn't one.

```markdown
> **Rebuild required before merge — `scan-containers` is red until then.**
>
> The triage below patched <N> CVE(s) by editing container yml(s), but the
> agent role on this sandbox cannot push rebuilt images to ECR. To finalize:
>
>   1. Pull the branch in an environment with ECR push:
>        git fetch origin <branch>
>        git checkout <branch>
>   2. Rebuild modified containers and update the tag pins in
>      configs/containers.config:
>        bin/build_ecr_containers.py
>   3. Commit and push the updated pins:
>        git add configs/containers.config containers/
>        git commit -m "Rebuild containers for CVE-XXXX-XXXXX [+ others]"
>        git push
>   4. Once `scan-containers` is green, delete this whole "Rebuild required"
>      callout from the PR body and mark the PR ready for review.

# Trivy triage

`scan-containers` on <origin> flagged <N> HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities. Each is triaged below.

## CVE-XXXX-XXXXX (<SEVERITY>, <pkg> <ver>)

<one-line vulnerability summary>. Fixed in <pkg> <fixed-ver>.

- **Action — <container(s)>:** **<Patch / Ignore / Escalate>** — <one-line reachability assessment + what we did>. <if Ignore: `.trivyignore` exp:YYYY-MM-DD, re-eval: <trigger>.>

## CVE-YYYY-YYYYY (...)
...
```

Omit the top callout entirely for Ignore-only or Escalate-only triages — it's only needed when at least one Patch outcome blocks merge on a rebuild. The callout is meant to be deleted from the PR body once the rebuild lands and CI is green; the assessment block stays as the audit trail.

**Keep it tight.** Reviewers need the outcome and why it's safe; NVD details are one click away. Don't paraphrase the vuln's internals, paste container filesystem paths, or list HTTP headers — that pads without informing.

**Worked example — mixed outcomes by container (urllib3 in awscli).** A single CVE sometimes splits outcomes. urllib3 is the canonical case: `multiqc` can be patched (urllib3 enters transitively via `requests`, so an explicit `urllib3=2.7.0` pin in `multiqc.yml` pulls in the fixed wheel) but the four awscli-bearing containers cannot (awscli's feedstock pins `urllib3<=2.6.3` across every conda-forge build, blocking the fix until awscli relaxes the cap). The triage outcome is Patch for one container group, Ignore for the other, in the same PR. Split the `Action` line by container group in the PR description:

```markdown
- **Action — multiqc:** **Patch** — `conda-forge::urllib3=2.7.0` pin in
  `containers/multiqc.yml` (multiqc reaches urllib3 only via `requests`).
- **Action — blast / bowtie2_samtools / kraken2 / minimap2_samtools:**
  **Ignore** — awscli pins `urllib3<=2.6.3` through every conda-forge
  build; awscli usage here is `update_blastdb.pl --source aws` and
  equivalents, no proxy or attacker-controlled compressed streams.
  `.trivyignore` exp:YYYY-MM-DD, re-eval: awscli feedstock relaxes the cap.
```

**Versioning / CHANGELOG.** A Trivy-only PR is typically a point bump on the in-flight `-dev` release. If a `-dev` point bump has already happened in this cycle for an unrelated change, just append a CHANGELOG line under the existing `-dev` heading without further bumping the version. The CHANGELOG entry is **one short sentence**: CVE IDs, outcome, one phrase on the fix-blocker. Per-CVE rationale belongs in `.trivyignore` and the PR body, not the CHANGELOG. Defer to the `version-bump` agent (per `CLAUDE.md`) if uncertain.

### Step 5 — Verify before push

- **Verify Patch outcomes by building the modified container locally and scanning it directly** (recommended for any non-trivial patch — transitive pins, version bumps, base-image swaps). The published-tag scan path won't see the yml change yet (see next bullet), so this is the only pre-merge way to catch a hallucinated fix. Requires local Docker + the `trivy` binary:

  ```bash
  # Build the modified yml into a local tag (no push — uses build_container() directly):
  python -c "from pathlib import Path; from bin.build_ecr_container import build_container; \
    build_container(Path('containers/<name>.yml'), 'triage-local:<name>', 'triage-local:<name>')"
  # Scan the local image with the same .trivyignore CI uses:
  trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --ignorefile .trivyignore triage-local:<name>
  ```

  Read the *whole* scan, not just the target CVE. Any new HIGH/CRITICAL the patch brings in is part of the patch decision and needs its own triage before you ask for a rebuild — every extra rebuild is a manual round-trip for the user. **For a base-image bump, scan every container, not just the one that reported the CVE**: the `pyproject.toml` knob feeds every generated Dockerfile, so the whole package set moves. If a local build isn't available, say so in the rebuild handoff rather than presenting the bump as verified, and expect a second triage round once the published images are scanned. If the target CVE doesn't drop out of the local scan, the patch didn't land. Common causes: (a) a feedstock cap keeps the fix unreachable through conda (the urllib3-in-awscli pattern, §2d) — reclassify as Ignore; (b) wrong package pinned — re-read the Trivy `PkgPath`; (c) base image hasn't been bumped though the CVE is system-level.

- **`bin/scan_containers.py` and the CI `scan-containers` job both scan the *published* tag pinned in `configs/containers.config`**, so neither reflects a Patch-side yml change until after the user-side rebuild. They cover Ignore-side outcomes only on a triage branch. Patch-side CVEs stay red on the PR until rebuild — by design.
- Re-run `bin/scan_containers.py` locally to confirm Ignore-side findings cleared. To wait for CI instead, push the branch and re-run the failed jobs against the latest run for the head SHA — don't push an empty commit (it fires every workflow):

  ```bash
  RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=trivy-scan.yml --branch <branch> --status completed --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
  gh api -X POST repos/securebio/nao-mgs-workflow/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/rerun-failed-jobs
  ```
- **If a post-rebuild scan disagrees with an image you verified locally, inspect the pinned artifact before re-patching.** `docker pull` the tag from `configs/containers.config` and check its digest and package versions. If the published image really does carry the old versions, triage that artifact. If it matches what you built, the disagreement is in the scan rather than the image: CI pins its own scanner (`TRIVY_VERSION` in `.github/workflows/trivy-scan.yml`) and its own DB snapshot, which can differ from the local `trivy` you verified with, and a scan can also race a fresh ECR push. Re-run the job only where there's reason to think the failure was transient — a rerun won't resolve a genuine version mismatch.
- Sanity-read the `.trivyignore` diff: every new line has a comment block with the four required pieces (vulnerability description, affected functionality + our usage, fix-blocker, expiry trigger).
- Check the PR-description block surfaces every finding, not just the ones you ignored.

## Anti-patterns this skill exists to prevent

1. **Adding a `.trivyignore` entry for a CVE that has an available fix**, to "cover the rebuild gap" or because the agent can't push images. Ignoring a fixable CVE buries a real vulnerability under stale-ignore boilerplate and conflates "unfixable" with "out of this environment's reach." Make the yml edit and hand off the rebuild per step 3a — don't ignore. (Disambiguation: a fix that exists in some upstream release but is unreachable through any current feedstock build — e.g. urllib3 2.7.0 exists, but every conda-forge `awscli` release pins `urllib3<=2.6.3` — counts as "no fix available" for the Ignore path. The distinguishing factor is whether changing the yml could actually pull a fixed build.)
2. **Bulk-adding CVEs to `.trivyignore` with one-line generic comments.** Each entry needs the four-piece assessment.
3. **"No Debian fix available" as the only stated reason.** That's a partial check, not a triage outcome. Confirm conda / base-image / upstream-tool paths are also dead ends before ignoring.
4. **Vague expiry dates** ("six months from now") rather than tied to a specific re-evaluation trigger (upstream release cadence, distro security backport window, etc.).
5. **Pinning the top-level package for a finding that came from a bundled copy** (null `PkgPath`; pip's `_vendor/` bundle is the usual source). The pin installs a separate copy alongside the bundled one, can import the pinned release's own vendored CVEs, and never clears the finding. Locate the code first, then look for a fix in the bundling package's releases (§2b).
6. **Hiding the assessment from the PR description.** The reviewer needs to see *why* each CVE was ignored, not just the `.trivyignore` diff. A reviewer who can't audit the assessment from the PR body alone has been given the easy path to rubber-stamp.

## Cross-references

- `.trivyignore` — the file you'll be editing for ignore cases. Existing entries are the format exemplar.
- `bin/scan_containers.py` — invokable locally for fresh scans.
- `bin/build_ecr_containers.py` / `bin/build_ecr_container.py` — **user-side** rebuild commands run after the triage PR lands. The agent role on this sandbox is ECR pull-only and does not run them end-to-end. The former iterates over `containers/`; the latter exposes `compute_spec_hash`, which decides whether a yml change forces a rebuild, and `build_container()`, which is the local-only build path the agent *does* call from Step 5's verification step.
- `.github/workflows/trivy-scan.yml` — the CI job that produces the artifact.
- `containers/*.yml` — conda env files for the project's containers; updates land here for patch cases.
- `docs/developer.md` — repo conventions (commits, PR practices).
