# Continuous Integration (CI)

We use continuous integration (CI) via GitHub Actions to perform a number of automated tests on each PR, as well as other non-test actions in certain cases. Our CI workflows are configured in `.github/workflows`.

## Overview

### Types of CI

Our CI workflows fall into three broad categories:

1. **Development tests:** Quick tests that must pass before code can be merged into `dev` or `main`.
2. **Release tests:** Slow or expensive tests that must pass for a PR to be merged into `main`. To enable rapid development, these tests are not required on PRs into `dev`.
3. **Non-test automation:** Workflows that perform actions like creating releases, managing branches, or tagging issues.

### Runners and billing

Most of our CI workflows use GitHub's standard `ubuntu-latest` runner for execution. We have 3,000 free minutes of execution with this runner per month across our entire SecureBio GitHub account, which is enough for most purposes. This runner is also quite throttled in its [resources](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners) and will struggle with demanding tasks.

For tests that demand multiple cores or other substantial resources, we use custom runners set up in the SecureBio Team account. These cost a small amount of money per minute of execution: for example, the `ubuntu-16` runner we use for several tests [costs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing) about $0.04 per minute. These costs are small enough to generally not be a concern, but developers should take care if adding very long-running tests or doing extensive iterative testing of a new CI workflow.

Several workflows access external resources, including AWS S3 and AWS Batch, and will incur corresponding costs for compute and storage. As above, these costs are usually not large enough to be problematic, but developers should take care around changes that could substantially increase our resource load.

### Conditional execution

Many of our CI tests have two desiderata that are somewhat in tension with each other:

1. We want certain tests to run on every PR and to block merging if they fail; but
2. We also want to avoid running tests pointlessly if the files they test haven't been modified.

The simple approach of just setting run conditions in each CI file fails here; if these conditions aren't met, the test will not run, and the PR will be blocked by our branch protection rules.

To achieve both of these goals, many of our test workflows instead use the [dorny/paths-filter](https://github.com/dorny/paths-filter) action to check whether relevant files have changed. If no relevant files are modified, downstream steps in the workflow are skipped and the workflow succeeds trivially; otherwise, the downstream steps run and the test succeeds or fails based on their outcomes.

To see the files each CI test checks before executing, refer to the files in the `.github` directory.

### The `ci-test` branch

`ci-test` is a special branch used for testing CI workflows. All checks that would run on PR or merge into `dev` or `main` are also configured to run on PR into `ci-test`. This allows us to test execution of checks that would otherwise be skipped on a PR into `dev`.

If submitting a PR that affects our CI, the recommended process is:

1. Submit a PR to merge your working branch into `ci-test`;
2. Wait for all tests to complete and fix any that fail;
3. Get approval from a reviewer while still on `ci-test`;
4. After making any final changes and checking that all tests pass, switch the destination branch to `dev`;
5. Merge the PR.

## Development tests

These tests run on PRs to `main`, `dev`, `stable`, and `ci-test`. They must pass before code can be merged.

### nf-test

We have several nf-test workflows that test different parts of the pipeline:

| Workflow | Tests |
|----------|-------|
| `nf-test-modules.yml` | `tests/modules/` |
| `nf-test-subworkflows.yml` | `tests/subworkflows/` |
| `nf-test-workflows-index.yml` | `tests/workflows/index.nf.test` |
| `nf-test-workflows-run.yml` | `tests/workflows/run.nf.test` |
| `nf-test-workflows-downstream.yml` | `tests/workflows/downstream.nf.test` |
| `nf-test-wave-config.yml` | `tests/workflows/wave.nf.test` |

The `nf-test-wave-config.yml` CI workflow checks that the private
`wave.tokens.cache.maxDuration` option in `configs/profiles.config` is applied at runtime.

### Python unit tests (`pytest.yml`)

Runs our entire pytest suite across `bin` and `modules`.

### Mypy type checking (`mypy.yml`)

Runs `mypy` on all Python code in `bin/` and `modules/local/`. Uses `dorny/paths-filter` to trivially succeed when no Python files have changed.

### Ruff lint and format check (`ruff.yml`)

Runs `ruff check .` (lint) and `ruff format --check .` (formatting verification) on the whole repo, using the `[tool.ruff]` configuration in `pyproject.toml`. Both checks are read-only — CI never auto-fixes; contributors must run `ruff check --fix .` and `ruff format .` locally and commit the results. Uses `dorny/paths-filter` to trivially succeed when no Python files, `pyproject.toml`, or the workflow itself have changed.

### Rust tools (`rust-tools.yml`)

Runs Rust unit tests and builds the `nao-rust-tools` container when Rust source files change. This workflow runs on all PRs but uses `dorny/paths-filter` to trivially succeed (~10 seconds) when no Rust files have changed. When Rust files are modified, it runs `cargo test` and builds the container. On push to `dev` or `main`, it also pushes the container to ECR.

### Trivy container scan (`trivy-scan.yml`)

Scans all containers defined in `configs/containers.config` for security vulnerabilities using [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/).

### Scheduled Trivy scan and triage (`scheduled-trivy-triage.yml`)

Runs the same Trivy scan on a weekly schedule (Mondays 06:00 UTC) rather than per-PR, so HIGH/CRITICAL container CVEs are caught even in weeks with no container-touching PR. The job checks out and scans `dev`; when the scan reports HIGH/CRITICAL findings, it invokes the `triage-trivy` skill (in its PR-less scheduled mode) via `anthropics/claude-code-action` to open a draft triage PR against `dev`.

### Version and changelog checks

These checks run unconditionally (no path filtering) to ensure version consistency across the codebase.

| Workflow | Description | Branches |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `check-version.yml` | Runs `bin/check_version.py` to verify version numbers are consistent | all |
| `check-nextflow-version.yml` | Runs `bin/check_nextflow_version.py` to ensure Nextflow version is current | all |
| `check-changelog.yml` | Requires `CHANGELOG.md` update if non-documentation files changed | `dev`, `ci-test` only |

The Nextflow version check compares the version pinned in `configs/profiles.config` against the highest-semver Nextflow release on GitHub, after filtering out any releases listed in `.nextflowignore` at the repo root. To suppress a specific upstream release (for example, a broken release we never want to pin to, or a major bump we are deferring until tooling catches up), add an entry to `.nextflowignore`:

- `<X.Y.Z>` — permanent ignore.
- `<X.Y.Z> exp:YYYY-MM-DD` — ignore until `YYYY-MM-DD`, after which the entry expires; expired entries print a warning to stderr and are treated as absent, so stale temporary ignores cannot accumulate silently.

Lines beginning with `#` and blank lines are ignored; trailing `# ...` comments on entry lines are also stripped. The pinned version must equal the latest eligible release exactly: if the highest-semver upstream release is currently ignored, the check falls back to the next-highest non-ignored release. A mismatch typically means either `configs/profiles.config` needs to be bumped, or the new release needs an entry in `.nextflowignore` with a justification.

## Release tests

These tests run on PRs to `main`, `stable`, and `ci-test`. They are slower or more expensive than development tests and are not required for merging to `dev`, but must pass before merging to `main`.

### Rust container handling

Release tests use Wave/Fusion for container orchestration. The `setup-rust-container` composite action (`.github/actions/setup-rust-container/`) handles Rust container setup:

- If Rust code matches `origin/main` → use ECR `:main` container
- If Rust code matches `origin/dev` → use ECR `:dev` container
- Otherwise → build the container locally (with GitHub Actions caching by content hash)

This approach avoids complex sequencing between workflows while ensuring tests always run against the correct Rust code.

> [!NOTE]
> There is a rare edge case: if you merge Rust changes to `dev` and immediately open a PR to `main` before `rust-tools.yml` finishes pushing to ECR, the PR could use a stale `:dev` container. To avoid this, check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/securebio/nao-mgs-workflow/actions/workflows/rust-tools.yml) and wait for the "Rust Tools CI" workflow triggered by your merge to complete before opening release PRs with Rust changes.

### Integration test (`test-chained.yml`)

Runs the full pipeline on small test data using `bin/chain_workflows.py`, executing INDEX, RUN, and DOWNSTREAM workflows in sequence.

### Benchmark tests

These tests run the pipeline on larger benchmark datasets to verify performance and correctness at scale.

| Workflow | Dataset |
|----------|---------|
| `benchmark-illumina-100M.yml` | Illumina 100M reads |
| `benchmark-ont-100k.yml` | ONT 100k reads |

### Benchmark index age check (`check-index-age.yml`)

Runs on PRs to `main` and `stable`. Checks the age of the benchmark index at `s3://nao-testing/mgs-workflow-test/index-latest/` against the `max-stable-index-age-days` setting in `pyproject.toml` (default: 90 days). If the index is too old, the check fails and the index should be rebuilt manually: run the INDEX workflow against the latest reference configs, then upload the resulting index to `s3://nao-testing/mgs-workflow-test/index-latest/`. See [the installation guide](./installation.md) for instructions on building an index.

### Release readiness check (`check-release.yml`)

Runs only on PRs to `main`. Verifies that:
1. The version in `pyproject.toml` has a corresponding changelog section
2. The version has not already been released on GitHub

This check runs unconditionally (no path filtering).

## Non-test automation

These workflows perform automated actions rather than running tests.

### Create release (`create-release.yml`)

Triggered on push to `main`. Automatically creates a GitHub release and tag based on:
1. The version number extracted from `pyproject.toml`
2. The changelog section for that version extracted by `bin/extract_changelog.py`

### Reset branches (`reset-branches.yml`)

Triggered on push to `main`. After a release is merged, this workflow:
1. Resets `dev` to match `main` (force push)
2. Resets `ci-test` to match `main` (force push)
3. Conditionally resets `stable` to match `main` only for point releases (where the first three version numbers X.Y.Z match)

This uses a GitHub App token for authentication to allow force pushes to protected branches.

### Manual stable reset (`manual-reset.yml`)

Manually triggered (`workflow_dispatch`). Resets the `stable` branch to match `main` via force push. Used when a non-point release (one that changes any of the first three version numbers) needs to be propagated to `stable`, since `reset-branches.yml` only auto-resets `stable` for point releases. See [`docs/developer.md`](./developer.md) for how this fits into the release process.

The workflow is gated by two layers of protection:

1. **`stable-reset` environment.** The `reset-stable` job runs in the `stable-reset` GitHub Actions [environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/manage-environments-for-deployment), which is configured (in the repository settings) to be restricted to the `main` branch and to require human approval before any job in it can run. This is the primary gate.
2. **Confirmation string.** The job additionally requires the user to type `reset stable` as a `workflow_dispatch` input, as defense-in-depth against accidental dispatch.

When adding or modifying environment-gated workflows, both the environment configuration (in GitHub UI) and the `environment:` key in the workflow YAML need to be kept consistent.

### Label issues (`label-issues.yml`)

Triggered when issues are opened. Automatically adds the `repo:mgs-workflow` label to new issues for tracking across the organization.
