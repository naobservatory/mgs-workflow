# Outputs

If the pipeline runs to completion, the following output files are expected. In the future, we will add more specific information about the outputs, including in-depth descriptions of the columns in the output files.

All pipeline output can be found in the `output` directory, which is broken into five subdirectories:

- `input`: Directory containing saved input information (useful for trying to reproduce someone else's results)
- `logging`: Log files containing meta-level information about the pipeline run itself.
- `intermediates`: Intermediate files produced by key stages in the run workflow, saved for nonstandard downstream analysis.
- `results`: Directory containing processed results files for standard downstream analysis.
- `experimental`: Directory containing experimental outputs that are under active development and not yet guaranteed to be stable. See below for details.

## Experimental outputs

The `experimental/` (INDEX and RUN workflows) and `experimental_downstream/` (DOWNSTREAM workflow) directories contain outputs that are under active development. Files in these directories:

- Are NOT tracked in the `expected-outputs-*` lists in `pyproject.toml`
- Are NOT guaranteed to have schemas or complete documentation
- May change or be removed in any release, including point (4th-number) releases

Downstream consumers use experimental outputs at their own risk, and are responsible for keeping their code up to date with changes in the structure and contents of these files across releases. Once ready, experimental outputs are promoted into regular outputs and become subject to the standard output guarantees.

## Run workflow

Main heading represents the folder name, and subheadings represent a description of the file's usage. If the file is not in the heading folder name, the relative path is given.

### `input/`

- `adapters.fasta`: FASTA file of adapter sequences used for adapter screening.
- `params-index.json`: JSON file giving parameters used to generate index directory (`params.ref_dir`).
- `params-run.json`: JSON file giving all the parameters passed to the pipeline.
- `samplesheet.csv`: Copy of the samplesheet file used to configure the pipeline (specified by `params.sample_sheet`).

### `logging/`

- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration file containing the pipeline version and compatibility version constraints (copied from repository).
- `pyproject-index.toml`: Project configuration file from the index directory, containing the index's pipeline version and compatibility constraints (copied from index directory).
- `sentinel.json`: Completion marker written after all expected output files have been verified. Contains `runStartedAt` and `runCompletedAt` timestamps. External systems can check for this file to confirm the run completed successfully. The `sentinel_max_wait_mins` parameter (default 32) controls how long to wait for expected outputs before timing out.
- `trace_<timestamp>.tsv`: Tab delimited log of all the information for each task run in the pipeline including runtime, memory usage, exit status, etc. Can be used to create an execution timeline using the the script `bin/plot-timeline-script.R` after the pipeline has finished running. More information regarding the trace file format can be found [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reports.html#trace-file).

### `intermediates/`

- `aligner_hits_all.tsv.gz`: List of all putative viral alignments (primary, secondary and supplementary) from the aligner used in the `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS` subworkflow (bowtie2 for short reads or minimap2 for ONT) with modified columns from the [SAM specification](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).
- `lca_hits_all.tsv.gz`: List of putative viral reads after having applied LCA to `aligner_hits_all.tsv.gz`, along with columns representing summary statistics.
- `reads/raw_viral/*`: Directory containing raw reads corresponding to those reads that survive initial viral k-mer screening (with Nucleaze). (Note: this is not currently produced for ONT data.)

### `results/`

#### QC
- `{sample}_read_counts.tsv`: Total number of raw reads for a given sample.
- `{sample}_qc_adapter_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_adapter_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Adapter statistics calculated by FASTQC for subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, given as a percentage of reads containing adapter content (`pc_adapters`) at each position along the read (`position`) for each adapter detected (`adapter`) for each read in the read pair (`read_pair`).
- `{sample}_qc_basic_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_basic_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Summary statistics for each subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, including:
    - GC content (`percent GC`);
    - Average read length (`mean_seq_len`);
    - Number of read pairs (`n_read pairs`);
    - Approximate number of base pairs in reads (`n_bases_approx`);
    - Percent duplicates as measured by FASTQC (`percent_duplicates`);
    - Pass/fail scores for each test conducted by FASTQC.
- `{sample}_qc_length_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_length_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Per-read length statistics calculated by FASTQC for subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, given as the number of reads (`n_sequences`) with a given read length (`read_length`) for each read in the read pair (`read_pair`).
- `{sample}_qc_overrepresented_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_overrepresented_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Overrepresented sequences identified by FASTQC for subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, given as the sequence (`sequence`), the number of reads matching it (`n_occurrences`), and that count as a percentage of the sample's reads at that stage (`pc_reads`). Some details about the FASTQC implementation:
    - FASTQC truncates each read to its first 50 bases before comparing them, so two reads that agree on those first 50 bases but differ afterward are treated as the same (50 base) sequence. At our read lengths that applies to essentially every read on both platforms.
    - Only sequences making up more than 0.1% of the sample's reads at that stage are listed, and at most the 100 most frequent are published.
    - Percentages are relative to that sample and stage's own read count, counted in **mates, not pairs**. A sequence present in every R1 and no R2 therefore reads as ~50%.
    - To bound memory, FASTQC only tracks sequences seen among the first 100,000 unique sequences in the file.
- `{sample}_qc_quality_base_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_quality_base_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Per-base read-quality statistics calculated by FASTQC for subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, given as the mean Phred score (`mean_phred_score`) at each position along the read (`position`) for each read in the read pair (`read_pair`).
- `{sample}_qc_quality_sequence_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_quality_sequence_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`: Per-sequence read-quality statistics calculated by FASTQC for subset sample before (`raw`) and after (`cleaned`) adapter trimming, given as the number of reads (`n_sequences`) with a given mean Phred score (`mean_phred_score`) for each read in the read pair (`read_pair`).
- `{sample}_fastp.json`: Per-sample FASTP diagnostic data in JSON format, including read counts, quality metrics (Q20/Q30 rates), adapter statistics, and filtering results. Only produced for short-read (non-ONT) runs. Note that the `overrepresented_sequences` keys in this file are always empty since we do not pass `-p` to fastp. Use `{sample}_qc_overrepresented_{stage}.tsv.gz` instead.

#### Viral identification
- `virus_hits_final.tsv.gz`: TSV output from EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS, giving information about each read pair assigned to a host-infecting virus, using the LCA taxid assignment as the source of truth. Contains both LCA-based taxonomic assignments (columns with `aligner_` prefix) that utilize multiple alignments per read, and read sequence information plus primary alignment details (columns with `prim_align_` prefix) for the DOWNSTREAM workflow. See [virus_hits_final.md](./virus_hits_final.md) for documentation of column names.

#### Taxonomic identification
- `{sample}_bracken.tsv.gz`: Bracken output reports in TSV format for a given sample, labeled by ribosomal status, for subset samples produced by SUBSET_TRIM.
- `{sample}_kraken.tsv.gz`: Kraken output reports in TSV format for a given sample, labeled by ribosomal status, for subset samples produced by SUBSET_TRIM.

## Downstream workflow

### `logging_downstream/`

- `{group}_sentinel.json`: Per-group completion marker written after all expected DOWNSTREAM output files for that group have been verified. Contains `downstreamStartedAt` and `downstreamCompletedAt` timestamps. One file is written and published independently per group in the input CSV, so external systems can check for each file to confirm DOWNSTREAM completed successfully for that group. If the input CSV resolves to an empty groups channel (e.g. a groups TSV with only a header), no sentinels are written at all. The `sentinel_max_wait_mins` parameter (default 32) controls how long to wait for expected outputs before timing out.

## Index workflow

Main heading represents the folder name, and subheadings describes the tool that consumes the file. Files that are consumed by multiple tools or are not consumed by any tools are put in the `General` subheading. If the file is not in the heading folder name, the relative path is given.

### `input/`

- `index-params.json`: JSON file giving all the parameters passed to the pipeline (useful for trying to reproduce someone else's results).
- `host-infection-overrides.json`: the per-host taxid overrides applied when annotating the virus DB, copied verbatim from the build inputs so the index records the surveillance rules used to build it.

### `logging/`

- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration file containing the pipeline version and compatibility version constraints (copied from repository).
- `time.txt`: Start time of index workflow run.
- `trace.txt`: Nextflow trace file containing logging information for each process performed during the workflow run.

### `results/`

#### General

- `total-virus-db-annotated.tsv.gz`: Database generated from NCBI taxonomy and Virus-Host-DB giving taxonomy and host-infection information for each viral taxon.
- `virus-genome-metadata-raw.tsv.gz`: Every viral assembly enumerated under the target taxon, before the host-infection and assembly-status filters are applied. Lets downstream tooling see each assembly's build-time taxid and release date, including those the filters drop.
- `taxonomy-nodes.dmp`: Taxonomy dump file from NCBI mapping between taxids and their parents in the NCBI taxonomy tree structure.
- `taxonomy-names.dmp`: Taxonomy dump file from NCBI mapping between taxids and taxon names.

#### BLAST

- `blast_db`: Directory containing the extracted BLAST database volume files, exposed under a constant `blast_db` alias (a `blast_db.nal` built with `blastdb_aliastool`) so consumers reference a fixed path regardless of which database (e.g. `core_nt`) was downloaded.

#### Bowtie2

- `bt2-virus-index`: Directory containing Bowtie2 index for host-infecting viral genomes.
- `bt2-human-index`: Directory containing Bowtie2 index for the human genome.

- `virus-genome-metadata-gid.tsv.gz`: Genome metadata file generated during download of vertebrate viral genomes[^vertebrate] from viral Genbank, annotated additionally with Genome IDs used by Bowtie2 (allowing mapping between genome ID and taxid). Only includes sequences actually present in `virus-genomes-masked.fasta.gz` after filtering and deduplication.

[^vertebrate]: We say "vertebrate-infecting viruses" here and throughout the documentation for convenience, as the pipeline currently looks for vertebrate-infecting viruses by default. However, which viruses the pipeline looks for is configurable based on how you set up the index workflow.

#### Minimap2

- `mm2-virus-index`: Directory containing minimap2 index for host-infecting viral genomes.
- `mm2-human-index`: Directory containing minimap2 index for the human genome.

#### K-mer screening references

- `virus-genomes-masked.fasta.gz`: FASTA file containing host-infecting viral genomes downloaded from viral Genbank (filtered to remove transgenic, contaminated, or erroneous sequences).
- `virus-genomes-masked.nucleaze.bin`: Pre-built [Nucleaze](https://github.com/jackdougle/nucleaze) k-mer index over the masked viral genomes, consumed by RUN's viral k-mer screen. Built from the masked viral genomes with human (CHM13) k-mers additionally N-masked out.
- `ribo-ref-concat.fasta.gz`: Reference database of ribosomal LSU and SSU sequences from SILVA, used by RUN's BBDuk-based ribosomal screen.
