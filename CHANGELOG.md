# v3.4.0.0-dev

- Add exemplar-attributed total columns to clade counts: `reads_direct_total_by_exemplar` and `reads_clade_total_by_exemplar` count every read under the taxon of the exemplar representing it, rather than under its own. (#980)
- Restrict Illumina BLAST validation downsampling to reads that are unique under both duplicate-marking passes. (#973)
- Promote similarity-based duplicate marking out of experimental, publishing columns into `results_downstream/{GROUP}_validation_hits.tsv.gz`. (#972)
    - Stop publishing `experimental_downstream/{GROUP}_duplicate_reads_similarity.tsv.gz`.
    - `{GROUP}_clade_counts.tsv.gz` now deduplicates on `sim_dup_exemplar` rather than `prim_align_dup_exemplar`.
- Publish FASTQC's overrepresented sequences as `{sample}_qc_overrepresented_{raw,cleaned}.tsv.gz` RUN outputs and matching `{group}_qc_overrepresented_{raw,cleaned}.tsv.gz` DOWNSTREAM outputs, with a new schema. Also correct the `overrepresented_sequences` description in `fastp.schema.json` and `output.md`. (#954)
    - See [output.md](docs/output.md) for how to read the numbers. A header-only file means no overrepresented sequences were reported.
    - DOWNSTREAM at this version requires RUN output produced at this version or later, since it treats every entry in `expected-outputs-run` as mandatory.
- Pass the `mark_duplicates` deviation tolerance explicitly instead of through a mutable global, with no change in behaviour. (#989)
- Add unit tests for the `mark_duplicates` Rust tool. (#967)

# v3.3.0.0

## Deprecating DOWNSTREAM's VSEARCH clustering with hash-based downsampling

- Replace VSEARCH clustering with deterministic hash-based downsampling: (#908, #911, #912, #930)
    - Each per-species partition is downsampled to at most `params.validation_n_sample` reads, those reads are BLASTed, and every hit carries its own `validation_status` (`aligned` / `no_alignment` / `not_sampled`) rather than one inherited from a cluster representative.
    - The downsample is confined to duplicate-group exemplars where duplicate marking ran. ONT skips duplicate marking and is unaffected.
    - Illumina validates 20 reads per species, ONT validates 1000000. Replaces the `validation_cluster_identity` and `validation_n_clusters` parameters with `validation_n_sample`, and drops the injected `cluster_min_len`.
    - **This changes the schema and contents of `validation_hits.tsv.gz`**: the eight `vsearch_*` columns are dropped and the string `group_species` becomes the integer `selected_taxid`, taking the table from 66 to 59 fields. Most reads are now labelled `not_sampled` instead of inheriting a representative's verdict.
    - Removes everything the clustering step left unused: the `clusterViralAssignments`, `propagateValidationInformation` and `validateClusterRepresentatives` subworkflows; the `vsearch`, `processVsearchClusterOutput` and `downsampleFastnById` modules; the `vsearch` container and `vsearch_resources` label; the uncalled `ADD_SAMPLE_COLUMN_LIST` process; the `fastq` output of `SPLIT_VIRAL_TSV_BY_SELECTED_TAXID`; and the `process_vsearch_cluster_output` crate from the `rust-tools` workspace and container.
- Add the components the new validation path is assembled from. None is called by a workflow yet: `ANNOTATE_VALIDATION_STATUS` (#909); `DOWNSAMPLE_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENTS` (#910); and `VALIDATE_SAMPLED_READS`, which computes the taxonomic distance between original and validated assignments (#916).
- Add an `annotated` output to `SPLIT_VIRAL_TSV_BY_SELECTED_TAXID`: the whole joined table before partitioning, with `selected_taxid` added and `taxid_species` dropped. Existing outputs are unchanged and nothing consumes it yet. (#917)

## Reference and index data

- Deduplicate the viral genome FASTA by sequence ID rather than by full header. (#904, #933)
- Mask human (CHM13) k-mers out of the viral genomes before building the Nucleaze k-mer index, and exclude two records that are pure human contamination (`AY037928.1` and `NC_022518.1`). (#886)
- Add a `FILTER_METADATA_TO_FASTA` step to `MAKE_VIRUS_GENOME_DB` so the published `virus-genome-metadata-gid.tsv.gz` has exactly one row per sequence in the published FASTA, erroring if a FASTA sequence has no metadata or if duplicate `genome_id` rows disagree on sequence-derived fields. (#934, #935)
- Streamline `MAKE_VIRUS_GENOME_DB` to reduce inter-process file staging and remove two latent scale limits in the genome DB build by padding chunk filenames and streaming metadata files. (#897, #939)

## Performance

- Replace `MINIMAP2_NON_STREAMED` with a `split_index` flag on `MINIMAP2`, and optimize the process with `pigz`, `-t ${task.cpus}`, and named FIFOs. The named FIFOs also fix a latent bug where the task could exit before a branch compressor had flushed its gzip trailer, silently truncating outputs. (#871, #942, #943, #944)
- Size GNU `sort`'s buffer explicitly in `SORT_FILE` and `SORT_FASTQ`, and tier task CPU and memory by input size. (#924)
- Rewrite `SORT_TSV` as a streaming pipeline on the same `SortUtils` helper: the table is no longer staged uncompressed in the work directory twice, `sort`'s spill moves to local disk, and CPU and memory are tiered by input size. Sorted contents are unchanged for well-formed input; the `.gz` bytes differ because output compression moves from `gzip -9` to `pigz -1`, and rows now pass through byte for byte where the previous implementation stripped whitespace from the first data row. (#949)
- Compress `SORT_FILE` and `SORT_FASTQ` output with `pigz -1` rather than the default level 6, matching `NUCLEAZE` and the pipeline's other intermediate-producing processes. Contents are unchanged; the `.gz` bytes differ. (#949)

## Cleanup and best practice

- Require Nextflow `>=26.04.6` (from `25.10.4`), the first of a stacked series upgrading the pipeline to Nextflow 26. Sets `aws.client.socketTimeout` to `3600000` (NF 26.04 rejects the previous `0`), bumps the `nft-fastq` / `nft-bam` nf-test plugins and pins nf-test to `0.9.5` in CI, and drops the now-moot `26.04.x` `.nextflowignore` deferrals. (#855)
- Replace per-profile `errorStrategy` / `maxRetries` settings with a single universal dynamic strategy (retry up to `maxRetries`, then `ignore`), so a failed task no longer terminates the whole run once retries are exhausted; `workflow.failOnIgnore` keeps the run's exit status non-zero when a task was ignored. A new `nf_test` profile overrides the strategy back to `finish` so negative tests can still assert on task failure. (#845)
- Set `wave.tokens.cache.maxDuration = '24h'` and `wave.retryPolicy.maxAttempts = 20` to reduce transient Wave infrastructure failures, with a test and CI workflow checking the private cache setting still reaches the Wave client. (#915)
- Bump the container base image to the current `mambaorg/micromamba` digest (openssl `3.5.6-1~deb13u2`, liblzma5 `5.8.1-1+deb13u1`, micromamba 2.6.2 to 2.9.0), pin Pillow to 12.3.0 in the MultiQC container to clear ten HIGH CVEs, and triage the remaining HIGH/CRITICAL Trivy findings (perl-base, openssl QUIC, util-linux, Go stdlib in ncbi-datasets-cli, quinn-proto in Polars, pip's vendored bundle) as unreachable with no reachable fix. (#931)
- Ignore two HIGH SQLite FTS5 CVEs (`CVE-2026-11822`, `CVE-2026-11824`) reported against `libsqlite3-0` in every container: exploiting either needs an FTS5 `MATCH` query against an attacker-supplied database, and the pipeline never opens a SQLite database. Debian trixie marks both `<no-dsa>` with the fix only in sid, so no `containers/*.yml` pin or base-image digest bump can reach it. (#950)
- Gate the Trivy container scan behind a paths-filter so it only runs when `containers/**` or `configs/containers.config` change (#882), factor the scan into a `.github/actions/trivy-scan` composite action with a PR-less mode for the `triage-trivy` skill (#883), and add a weekly scheduled scan that opens a draft triage PR against `dev` when HIGH/CRITICAL findings are present (#895).
- Widen that paths-filter to `.trivyignore`, `bin/scan_containers.py` and the workflow file itself, so a change to the ignore list or the scan harness is verified against a real scan instead of skipping the job and passing trivially. (#950)
- Publish a `rust-tools:stable` container image by adding `stable` to the push triggers and deriving the ECR tag from the branch name. (#884)
- Make the `[tool.<name>]` table read by `CHECK_VERSION_COMPATIBILITY` configurable. (#885)
- Document that `rust_tools_version` defaults to `:main` for dev builds and runs. (#881)

## Coding agents

- Add `bin/compare_downstream_runs.py` / `bin/downstream_metrics.py` and the paired `benchmark-downstream` skill for comparing two DOWNSTREAM runs from their existing output files. Reads existing outputs only; no pipeline, output or schema changes. (#860)
- Compare indexes in `bin/benchmark_index.py` after restricting to genomes published in the final FASTA, and report each index's build-time pipeline version. (#905)

# v3.2.2.0

## Screening and alignment changes

- Replace the BBDuk-based viral k-mer pre-screen in `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT` with [Nucleaze](https://github.com/jackdougle/nucleaze) (pinned to 1.5.0-alpha), changing which reads pass the viral screen. INDEX builds a new `virus-genomes-masked.nucleaze.bin` alongside the existing bowtie2/minimap2 indexes, and RUN reads `nucleaze_k` from the index so the screen-time `k` always matches the index it screens against. Bumps `pipeline-min-index-version` to `3.2.2.0`. (#766, #861, #867)
- Raise the minimum read length in `FASTP` from 15 bp to 35 bp, so reads too short to be classified by downstream k-mer tools no longer pass QC and deflate composition estimates. (#783)
- Add `-X 850` to all short-read bowtie2 invocations (viral and contaminant filtering) so concordantly paired inserts up to 850 bp are detected, up from the bowtie2 default of 500 bp. (#782)

## Reference and index data

- Refresh index inputs: bump the Kraken2 standard DB to `k2_standard_20260226` (from `20251015`), hard-exclude phage taxid `38018` ("Bacteriophage sp."), and broaden the four existing host-infection overrides (WNV, LCMV, Puumala, Banzi) to propagate through intermediate host groups. Changes the annotated virus DB and Kraken2 DB on next index rebuild. (#819)
- Add a host-infection override mechanism to `ANNOTATE_VIRUS_INFECTION` for taxa misannotated in Virus-Host-DB, forcing `MATCH` for listed per-taxid host groups; seeded with West Nile, LCMV, Puumala, and Banzi virus. (#811, #818)
    - Validate the overrides file against a JSON Schema at load, and reject entries referencing unknown host groups or taxids absent from the virus DB with clear errors instead of opaque failures deep in the loader. (#812, #813)
- Exclude viral genomes misannotated or contaminated in upstream reference data: five rRNA-contaminated records (#849), the plant/mycovirus taxa `1266451` and `1629671` (#830), and the routinely-misflagged Microviricetes, Smacoviridae, and Picobirnaviridae groups (#810).

## New workflow outputs

- INDEX now publishes `virus-genome-metadata-raw.tsv.gz`, the full set of enumerated viral assemblies before the host-infection and assembly-status filters, so tooling (e.g. index benchmarking) can attribute why a genome was or wasn't included. (#828)
- INDEX now publishes the host-infection overrides it applied to `input/host-infection-overrides.json`. (#852)
- Publish the BLAST database under a fixed `results/blast_db/` directory with a constant `blast_db` alias regardless of database name, and remove the now-redundant `blast_db_prefix` parameter from `configs/downstream*.config`. (#832)

## Performance

- Rework `MAKE_VIRUS_GENOME_DB` to enumerate viral accessions up-front, filter by host-infection and assembly status, then fan out download chunks to parallelize evenly across the taxonomic tree. (#807)
    - Replaces the INDEX `datasets_extra_args` parameter with the more specific `datasets_summary_extra_args` and `datasets_download_extra_args`.
- Speed up index genome staging via parallel fetches in `ADD_GENBANK_GENOME_IDS` (#809) and `CONCATENATE_GENOME_FASTA` (#808), and local-scratch staging with batched moves in `DOWNLOAD_VIRAL_GENOMES` (#780).
- Scale `MARK_ALIGNMENT_DUPLICATES` and `VSEARCH_CLUSTER` memory by input size to avoid OOM on large samples. (#853)
- Add `pigz` for parallel (de)compression to the `python` (#843) and `rust-tools` (#800) containers.

## Bugfixes

- Fix DOWNSTREAM failure at `WRITE_SENTINEL_DOWNSTREAM` on large batches (~100 groups) by throttling head-node S3 concurrency back to nf-amazon's default and capping the sentinel fan-out, preventing an S3 503 → retry → semaphore-exhaustion cascade. (#816)
- Fix `GET_TARBALL` referencing an undefined `huge_mem` resource label (should be `single_huge_mem`), which caused a silent fallback to default resources and OOM kills (exit 140). (#827)
- Fix a crash in the `ADD_CONDITIONAL_TSV_COLUMN` and `COUNT_READS_PER_CLADE` TSV readers when a `query_qual` field begins with a `"` character, by disabling CSV quote handling. (#824)
- Make `DOWNLOAD_VIRAL_GENOMES` retry the dehydrated `datasets download` step with exponential backoff, so a transient NCBI stream error there no longer aborts the task. (#828)
- Fix the `Show version info` step in the manual-reset workflow, which failed on non-checked-out branch refs. (#805)
- Add `set -euo pipefail` to the `BLASTN` module. (#838)

## Cleanup and best practice

- Add `tag "id=<value>"` directives to all `modules/local/` processes for per-task trace attribution, with runtime (`assertTraceTagsValid`) and static (`check_process_tags.py`) validation, and remove the now-unused `CONCATENATE_FILES` and `CONCATENATE_TSVS` processes. (#756, #807)
    - Drop the `env` column from `trace.fields` in both logging configs (its values contain literal newlines that break TSV parsing); consumers parsing the published trace file should update accordingly.
- Add a Ruff lint/format CI gate and bring the Python codebase into conformance (config, mechanical sweep, and behaviour-affecting autofixes). (#750, #751, #752)
- Clean up Nextflow code for strict-syntax / `nextflow lint` readiness, including the `splitCsv` flatMap refactor (#858) and removal of `.out` property access ahead of static typing (#856). (#748)
- Refresh the `.nextflowignore` deferral window for Nextflow `26.04.x` to keep `check-nextflow-version` green (pinned Nextflow `25.10.4` unchanged). (#821, #859)
- Triage container CVEs: move `container-base-image` to the Debian trixie digest to clear the libgnutls30 family (#815), pin/ignore the urllib3 CVEs per container (#803), waive the remaining unreachable perl-base and Go-stdlib findings (#821), and refresh the lapsed `.trivyignore` batch plus newly-surfaced findings (openssl, acl/attr, Go-stdlib, pyo3, gzip), all unreachable in the pipeline with per-CVE re-eval triggers (#869, #875).
- Harden the manual-reset workflow behind a gated `stable-reset` environment, and remove the unused rebuild-benchmark-index workflow and its dangling references. (#802)
- Fix the CHANGELOG CI check wrongly failing docs-only PRs (#840), and remove the slow, unnecessary disk-cleanup step from the nf-test setup action (#831).

## Coding agents

- Add `bin/benchmark_index.py` and the paired `benchmark-index` skill for vetting a candidate `s3://nao-mgs-index/<DATE>` build against the previous index before promoting it. (#814)
- Add the `triage-trivy` skill for structured per-CVE triage of `scan-containers` CI failures, structured to make `.trivyignore` the harder path. (#790)

# v3.2.1.5

## Performance

- Replace single-threaded gzip/zcat with pigz across `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT` modules (`BBDUK`, `BBDUK_HITS_INTERLEAVE`, `BOWTIE2`, `FASTP`, `SORT_FASTQ`, `SORT_FILE`); cuts cohort `RUN` cpu-hours by ~22% on the Illumina_100M benchmark. Adds `pigz=2.8` to the `bbtools`, `bowtie2_samtools`, `fastp`, and `coreutils` containers. (#774)
- Combine `SUBSET_READS_PAIRED_TARGET` with the previously-separate `INTERLEAVE_FASTQ` step into a single FIFO-based process that reads each input once and emits interleaved output via `seqtk mergepe`; the upstream `COUNT_READS` TSV is plumbed in so the in-process read-counting pass is eliminated. Output FASTQs are byte-identical to the previous chain. Adds `pigz=2.8` to the `seqtk` container. (#775)
- Swap `zcat` for `rapidgzip --count-lines` in `COUNT_READS` for ~3-4× faster gzip inflate at single-thread; allocation stays at `single` (1 cpu). Adds `rapidgzip=0.15.2` to the `coreutils_gzip_gawk` container. The broader pigz→rapidgzip sweep on other decompression hot paths is tracked in #776. (#777)

## Bugfixes

- Fix `samtools view` failure on duplicate sequence IDs in the concatenated viral genome FASTA produced by `CONCATENATE_GENOME_FASTA`. NCBI `datasets` sometimes returns superseded ("previous") assembly versions alongside current ones, causing duplicate accessions. (#758)
    - `DOWNLOAD_VIRAL_GENOMES` now emits an `assembly_status` column in the per-taxid metadata TSV, which `PREPARE_VIRAL_METADATA` flows through to `FILTER_VIRAL_GENBANK_METADATA`; only rows with `assembly_status == 'current'` are kept.
    - `CONCATENATE_GENOME_FASTA` now runs `seqkit rmdup --by-name` after concatenation as a defense-in-depth check (process switched from the `seqtk` to the `seqkit` container).
- Fix `CONCATENATE_GENOME_FASTA` `SIGPIPE` (exit 141) on large genome directories by adding an `|| true` escape path to the `head` call. (#779)

## Cleanup and best practice

- Extract the chained `chain_workflows.py` invocation shared by both benchmark workflows into a reusable composite action at `.github/actions/run-benchmark/`, and add a manual `benchmark-on-demand.yml` workflow (`workflow_dispatch` only) that calls the action with a `dataset:` choice input. The PR-triggered `benchmark-illumina-100M.yml` and `benchmark-ont-100k.yml` become thin callers of the same action; their behavior on PRs to `main`/`stable` is unchanged. Per-run `--base-dir` is now keyed by `${{ github.run_id }}` so manual triggers and auto-on-PR runs don't clobber each other's S3 outputs. (#773)
- Default `fusion.exportStorageCredentials = false` in the `standard`, `batch`, and `test_run` profiles, returning to Nextflow's framework default. Users who pass `--batch_job_role <ARN>` see no change; users running on AWS Batch without a job role now rely on the EC2 instance role for S3 access (per the existing `docs/batch.md` setup). The `ec2_s3` profile is unchanged. (#764)
- Improve Nextflow version checking: replace the hardcoded `EXCLUDED_VERSIONS` constant in `bin/check_nextflow_version.py` with a `.nextflowignore` config file supporting permanent and time-limited (`exp:YYYY-MM-DD`) ignores, and switch target selection to highest-semver-among-non-ignored. Pinned Nextflow version stays at `25.10.4`; `25.10.5` is permanently ignored because it was skipped over in bioconda, leaving our conda-based provisioning automations unable to install it. Also ignores `26.04.0` and `26.04.1` until 2026-06-01. (#760, #793)
- Register `.github/workflows/build-containers.yml` as a no-op stub on dev so the workflow file exists on main after the next dev→main release; GitHub's `workflow_dispatch` API requires this even when dispatching against a non-default ref. The real build-and-push implementation rides on companion PR #792. (#793)
- Add new HIGH-severity Trivy CVE waivers for libcap2, libgnutls30 (including TLS-PSK CVE-2026-42010/42011 and CVE-2026-3833 / -33845 / -33846), Pillow (multiqc), rustls-webpki (Polars in multiqc), and five Go stdlib 1.23.4 CVEs in the `ncbi_datasets` container. No Debian/upstream fix is available for any, and none is exercised by our pipeline. (#755, #759, #762, #774, #778)

## Coding agents

- Add `prepare-release` skill (`.claude/skills/prepare-release/`) for cutting the release PR into dev described in `docs/developer.md` § "New releases" step 2. The skill reads dev's accumulated `-dev` CHANGELOG bullets, classifies the overall bump level per `docs/versioning.md`, rewrites the bullets as a polished release note mirroring the v3.2.1.0 / v3.2.1.3 grouped structure, updates `pyproject.toml` + the CHANGELOG heading, and opens a `release/<handle>/<version>` PR into dev. The lighter `version-bump` agent remains the right tool for mid-stream bumps. (#794)
    - Extend `bin/check_version.py` release-branch detection to recognize `coding-agent/release/<version>` in addition to `release/<handle>/<version>`, since the `securebio-coding-agent` App can only push under `coding-agent/*`.
- Add `.claude/pr-examples/` directory containing worked examples of well-structured PR descriptions for this repo, with a `CLAUDE.md` reference pointing contributors at it. (#767)

# v3.2.1.4

- Tolerate viral taxa with no linked NCBI assemblies in `DOWNLOAD_VIRAL_GENOMES`, emitting a header-only `${taxid}_metadata.tsv` and an empty `${taxid}_genomes/` (now declared `optional`).
- Add CVE-2026-41989 (libgcrypt20) to `.trivyignore` (no fix currently available; expiry set in June 2026 to force review).
- Add `--batch_job_role` parameter to allow Batch profiles to use an IAM job role instead of exported AWS credentials.
- Prevent `MASK_FASTQ_READS` from running out of memory on merged ONT libraries larger than ~6 GB of gzipped FASTQ.
    - Replace `label "large"` with a new `label "bbmask_resources"` whose `memory` directive is an input-size-aware closure.
    - Define a generic `ResourceTierUtils` helper in `configs/resources.config` for the tier-selection logic.

# v3.2.1.3

## New workflow outputs

- Add `experimental/` and `experimental_downstream/` output directories for staging new outputs that are not yet guaranteed to be stable across point releases
- Add similarity-based duplicate marking to DOWNSTREAM as an experimental output via the new `MARK_SIMILARITY_DUPLICATES` module and `rust-tools/mark_duplicates_similarity` Rust library
- Add in-workflow verification of expected outputs to RUN and DOWNSTREAM via `WRITE_SENTINEL_*` processes. These check all expected outputs have been published, then write sentinel JSON files to output (`logging/sentinel.json` for RUN, `logging_downstream/{GROUP}_sentinel.json` for DOWNSTREAM)

## Cleanup and best practice

- Make `bin/run-nf-test.sh` and `bin/run_nf_test_parallel.py` symlink-safe for dependent repos
- Add authenticated ECR Public login to Trivy scan workflow to avoid anonymous pull rate limits
- Add several Trivy CVEs to `.trivyignore` (no fix currently available; expiry set in June 2026 to force review)
- Extract shared Groovy code for sentinel file generation to `lib/SentinelUtils.groovy`
- Remove `logging/time.txt` and `logging_downstream/time.txt`; superseded by new sentinel JSONs
- Make RUN workflow clearer and more readable by moving derived variables and conditional statements into subworkflows, including new `PREPARE_INPUT_LOGGING` and `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS` subworkflows

# v3.2.1.2

- Add `nucleaze` to the rust-tools container and bump Rust toolchain from 1.83 to 1.88.
- Continued to reduce INDEX workflow failures:
    - Wired new modules into `makeVirusGenomeDB` subworkflow, replacing `ncbi-genome-download` with NCBI `datasets` CLI for the INDEX workflow. Downloads are now parallelized across child taxa for better fault tolerance.
    - Removed `params.ncbi_viral_params` config parameter. Replaced with `params.assembly_source` (`"genbank"`, `"refseq"`, or `"all"`), `params.datasets_extra_args`, and optional `params.download_virus_taxid`. NCBI API keys are now read from the `NCBI_API_KEY` environment variable (used automatically by the `datasets` CLI).
- Addressed Trivy scan issues:
    - Switched rust-tools container base image from Debian bookworm-slim to Alpine 3.21 to fix CVE-2026-0861 and CVE-2023-45853.
    - Added CVE-2025-69720 (ncurses), CVE-2026-29111 (systemd), and CVE-2026-4046 (glibc iconv) to `.trivyignore` as no Debian bookworm fix is available for other containers.
    - Added expiration dates (`exp:2026-06-30`) to all `.trivyignore` entries to force periodic re-evaluation.
    - Enabled Trivy container vulnerability scans on all PRs (previously only triggered by container config changes).
- Added `sim_dup_group_size` column to `similarity_duplicate_marking` post-processing tool output.

# v3.2.1.1

- Hardened Trivy vulnerability scans against supply chain attacks by replacing unpinned apt installs with specific pinned version hashes.
- Added FASTP JSON output to published DOWNSTREAM outputs for QC (short-read data only).
- Began work to reduce INDEX workflow failures:
    - Reduced `DOWNLOAD_BLAST_DB` resource allocation to reduce peer-reset failures.
    - Used `xargs cat` instead of `cat $(cat ...)` in `CONCATENATE_GENOME_FASTA` to avoid argument-list-too-long errors with large genome databases.
    - Implemented new modules for downloading viral genomes using NCBI `datasets` CLI (not yet wired into workflow).
- Updated config files and documentation to enable direct specification of job queue from the command line.

# v3.2.1.0

## New workflow outputs

- Added FASTP JSON output to published RUN and DOWNSTREAM outputs for QC (short-read data only; ONT uses FILTLONG).
- Added `COMBINE_SAMPLE_JSONS` module and `CONCAT_JSON_BY_GROUP` subworkflow for combining per-sample JSON files into per-group outputs.
- Added `schemas/fastp.schema.json` (JSON Schema) for per-group FASTP output and extended `bin/validate_schemas.py` to validate JSON files against JSON Schema definitions.

## Cleanup & best practice

- Added mypy type-checking CI and type annotations to all Python scripts in `bin/` and `modules/local/`, with `pandas-stubs` and `types-PyYAML` stub dependencies.
- Updated benchmark CI workflow samplesheet paths to use `metadata/` and `raw/` subdirectories, matching internal standards.
- Updated containers to resolve Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH vulnerability scan failures.
- Migrated all 57 Nextflow modules from deprecated `shell:` blocks (`!{var}` interpolation) to `script:` blocks (`${var}` interpolation); `shell:` is deprecated in modern Nextflow.

## Bugfixes

- Updated `summarize-multiqc.R` to correctly handle changes in MultiQC JSON format in new version. Note: the MultiQC 1.21→1.33 upgrade changes read-length binning (e.g. bins shift from 224/274/324 to 200/250/300) and slightly alters `mean_seq_len` values; these are upstream MultiQC behavioral changes, not pipeline logic changes.
- Fixed O(N²) combinatorial explosion in `DISCOVER_RUN_OUTPUT` that caused OOM failures for large deliveries (~2,273 samples). Replaced glob-then-filter approach with direct path construction from known (sample, suffix) pairs, reducing channel items from O(files × samples) to O(samples × suffixes).
- Fixed two escaping bugs caught during the shell-to-script migration: `$RANDOM` in `subsetFastn` was being expanded by the shell instead of Bash at runtime, and the awk debug message in `extractViralHitsToFastq` was printing a field value instead of the numeric column index.

## Coding agents

- Add custom Claude Code subagent definitions (`.claude/agents/`) and update `.gitignore` to track them.

# v3.2.0.2

- Fixed AWS OIDC credential expiry in long-running CI workflows. Added `role-duration-seconds` input to the `setup-nf-test` composite action and increased session durations for `rebuild-benchmark-index` (6h), `benchmark-illumina-100M` (2h), `benchmark-ont-100k` (2h), and `test-chained` (2h). Also added a credential refresh step before the benchmark index cleanup to ensure it succeeds even if the main credentials expire.

# v3.2.0.1

- Added CI for tracking the age of the index used for benchmarking (`check-index-age.yml`) and regenerating it once stale (`rebuild-benchmark-index.yml`). The latter runs INDEX nf-tests as a preflight gate, deletes the old index, builds a fresh index to `s3://nao-testing/mgs-workflow-test/index-latest`, cleans up the Nextflow work directory, and verifies the new index passes the age check. The old index is recoverable via S3 bucket versioning.
- Fixed Groovy date format in INDEX, RUN, and DOWNSTREAM workflows: `YYYY` (week-year) → `yyyy` (calendar year) in `time.txt` timestamps.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with refinements from recent PRs.
- Added validation in DOWNSTREAM file discovery (`DISCOVER_RUN_OUTPUT`) that checks all expected per-sample RUN output files are present in `run_results_dir` before proceeding. Previously, missing files (e.g. due to incomplete S3 copies) caused the viral analysis pipeline to silently produce no output.

# v3.2.0.0

## DOWNSTREAM output cleanup

- Removed `{GROUP}_duplicate_reads.tsv.gz` from DOWNSTREAM outputs; its contents are a strict subset of `{GROUP}_validation_hits.tsv.gz`.
- Added group-level read count, Kraken, Bracken, and QC outputs to DOWNSTREAM workflow (`{GROUP}_read_counts.tsv.gz`, `{GROUP}_kraken.tsv.gz`, `{GROUP}_bracken.tsv.gz`, `{GROUP}_qc_*.tsv.gz`), produced for both short-read and ONT platforms.
    - At present, these new outputs simply concatenate RUN outputs across samples within a group to produce a single output table per group (with `sample` and `group` labels).
    - Future work may summarize outputs across groups (e.g. by summing read counts) but this is beyond the scope of this release.
- Added table schemas for all DOWNSTREAM outputs in `schemas/` directory; these are now enforced in CI for all outputs.
    - To enable a consistent schema, `{GROUP}_validation_hits.tsv.gz` files now have the same columns across Illumina and ONT samples; columns that only have meaning for paired-end data are always `NA` for single-end ONT samples and located at the end of each row.
    - The schema uses `fieldsMatch: "equal"` to tolerate column order differences.
- All RUN outputs are now reflected in at least one DOWNSTREAM output; using RUN outputs directly is deprecated.

## CI

- Removed branch restrictions from most CI workflows so they run on all PRs, not just PRs to specific branches. Long-running integration tests are unchanged, as are tests that only run on releases.
- Added manually-triggered GitHub Actions workflow (`manual-reset.yml`) for resetting the `stable` branch to `main` on non-point releases.

## Documentation

- Modified `docs/downstream.md` to point to `schemas/` for information on DOWNSTREAM output content.
- Extracted testing documentation from `docs/developer.md` into standalone `docs/testing.md` to keep documents at a readable length.
- Added CHANGELOG formatting guidelines to `docs/versioning.md`.
- Added `CLAUDE.md` with guidelines for Claude Code: GitHub interaction policies, PR workflows, testing, Python code style, etc.

## Other

- Reduced `maxRetries` from 3 to 1 in `standard` and `batch` profiles, and added guidance on falling back from spot to on-demand instances.

# v3.1.0.0

## Changes to output file schema

- Changed RUN outputs to per-sample format:
    - Read counts: `read_counts.tsv.gz` → `{sample}_read_counts.tsv`
    - QC stats: `subset_qc_*_stats.tsv.gz` → `{sample}_qc_*_stats_raw.tsv.gz` and `{sample}_qc_*_stats_cleaned.tsv.gz`
    - Taxonomy: `bracken_reports_merged.tsv.gz` → `{sample}_bracken.tsv.gz`, `kraken_reports_merged.tsv.gz` → `{sample}_kraken.tsv.gz`
    - Viral hits: `virus_hits_final.tsv.gz` → `{sample}_virus_hits.tsv.gz`
- Updated DOWNSTREAM to handle per-sample RUN outputs:
    - DOWNSTREAM workflow updated to auto-discover per-sample files from `run_results_dir` and parse groups from `groups_tsv`.
    - Dramatically simplified `prepareGroupTsvs` (now only needs to concatenate hits tables, never split them)
    - Added empty-group handling to `validateViralAssignments` (now creates empty validation-hits files for groups with no hits)

## Changes to data analysis

- Remove BLAST validation from RUN workflow (now only available in DOWNSTREAM workflow):
    - Deleted `BLAST_VIRAL` subworkflow, `SUBSET_FASTN` module, and `RUN_VALIDATION` workflow.
    - Removed `blast_viral_fraction` and related BLAST parameters from RUN workflow configs.
    - Removed unused `EXTRACT_VIRAL_HITS_TO_FASTQ_NOREF_LABELED` process (non-LIST version).
    - Removed `hits_fastq` output from `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT` and `EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_ONT` subworkflows (this concatenated interleaved FASTQ was used for BLAST validation).
    - Removed unused FASTQ extraction includes (`CONCATENATE_FILES`, `EXTRACT_VIRAL_HITS_TO_FASTQ`, `EXTRACT_SHARED_FASTQ_READS`).
- Removed Cutadapt from RUN workflow to reduce runtime and complexity. FASTP alone now handles adapter trimming for the short-read viral identification pipeline.
- Refactored `processVsearchClusterOutput` module to use streaming Rust implementation rather than memory-intensive Python/Pandas.
- Refactored extractViralReadsONT and process_viral_minimap2_sam.py so that processViralMinimap2Sam requires O(1) instead of O(num reads) memory.

## Testing & validation

- Added support for relative paths in DOWNSTREAM input CSV files, removing dependency on S3 inputs for testing:
    - Relative paths (not starting with `/` or `s3://`) are resolved against `params.input_base_dir` (defaults to `projectDir`).
    - Users can set `params.input_base_dir = launchDir` in their config to resolve paths relative to the launch directory.
    - S3 URIs and absolute paths continue to work as before.
    - Switched DOWNSTREAM tests to use local relative paths instead of S3 URIs.
- Added CI validation to ensure `test-data/results` files stay in sync with workflow snapshot MD5 sums:
    - Created `bin/validate_test_data_sync.py` script to validate local test data against nf-test snapshot MD5 sums.
    - Added `.github/workflows/validate-test-data.yml` CI workflow to run validation on PRs.
    - Renamed `test-data/results/` directories to match snapshot names (`run_output_shortread`, `run_output_ont`, `downstream_output_shortread`, `downstream_output_ont`).
- Added checking & enforcement of file structure for DOWNSTREAM `duplicate_stats` outputs using datapackage `table-schema` (proof-of-concept for later expansion):
    - Created `schemas/` directory with `duplicate_stats.schema.json` `table-schema` definition.
    - Added `bin/validate_schemas.py` script to validate output files against schemas using frictionless library.
    - Updated `CREATE_EMPTY_GROUP_OUTPUTS` to generate headers from schemas for empty output files where available.
    - Added schema validation step to DOWNSTREAM workflow CI after nf-test.
- Assorted changes to Github Actions CI:
    - Created reusable `.github/actions/setup-python` composite action for Python environment setup.
    - Added Rust build system to CI and rust-tools container to ECR.
    - Converted `setup-rust-container` from reusable workflow to composite action, simplifying CI check reporting.
    - Fixed CI bug where `--rust_tools_version dev` was passed to test runner instead of via environment variable.
    - Removed confusing `workflow_run` triggers from integration tests (benchmark and test-chained workflows).
- Migrate GitHub Actions AWS auth from static keys to OIDC role assumption (#657)

# v3.0.1.9

- Fix UP secondary alignment deduplication in filterViralSam (#621)
- Minor refinements to release process from testing on v3.0.1.9:
    - Switched from treating the release bot's App ID as a secret to a variable.
    - Updated documentation to remove requirement for review on final PR into `main`.
- Fix several sources of stochastic test failures:
    - Added missing memory specifications to BBTools processes
    - Broadened tolerable results ranges for probabilistic tests
    - Fixed bug in `download-db.sh` that was causing inter-run contamination of reference files
- Moved DB download functionality to `download_db.py` and implemented unit tests

# v3.0.1.8

## Streamlining release process

This version involved numerous changes intended to make new releases easier, faster and more robust:

- Pruning and accelerating testing:
    - Separated downloading part of `JOIN_RIBO_REF` into a separate `WGET` process, and tested both parts separately
    - Moved `ADD_CONDITIONAL_TSV_COLUMN` to Python and implemented `pytest` tests.
    - Moved `COUNT_READS_PER_CLADE` tests to `pytest`.
    - Deleted extraneous tests for `BOWTIE2` and `CONCATENATE_FILES`.
    - Created toy data files for several tests to reduce setup burden.
    - Created custom tiny reference datasets and switched tests to use them for increased speed.
    - Implemented parallel execution of `nf-test` via `bin/run_nf_test_parallel.py` and `bin/run-nf-test.sh`.
    - Added plaintext file handling to various processes to help with testing (by removing the need for `gzip`/`zcat` steps)
    - Implemented code for generating and uploading containers to ECR Public, and replaced Wave container paths with ECR paths. Among other benefits, this allows us to run the entire test suite without running into pull-rate limit errors.
- Automating workflow testing with Github Actions:
    - Whole `nf-test` suite now runs on PRs to main (`.github/workflows/nf-test-*`)
    - Chained `INDEX -> RUN -> DOWNSTREAM` integration test on toy data runs before PRs to `main` (`.github/workflows/test-chained.yml`)
    - Chained `RUN -> DOWNSTREAM` integration tests on real benchmark data (Illumina and ONT) before PRs to `main` (`.github/workflows/benchmark*.yml`)
    - In workflow tests (`.github/workflows/nf-test-workflows-*`) added verification that published outputs match expected outputs specified in `pyproject.toml`.
- Automated verification of repository metadata:
    - Consolidated version & output tracking into `pyproject.toml` & added a test for version consistency between `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md`. (`.github/workflows/check-version.yml`)
    - Enforced a minimum Nextflow version via `manifest` statement in `configs/profiles.config` & configured Github Actions to automatically source the same Nextflow version.
    - Added non-blocking check that installed Nextflow version is up to date. (`.github/workflows/check-nextflow-version.yml`)
    - Enforced `CHANGELOG.md` updates for PRs to `dev`. (`.github/workflows/check-changelog.yml`)
    - Added pre-merge validation to check changelog sections and prevent duplicate releases. (`.github/workflows/check-release.yml`)
- Automated release process upon merge to `main`:
    - Automated release creation and tagging on merge to `main`. (`.github/workflows/create-release.yml`)
        - Created `bin/extract_changelog.py` to extract changelog content for releases, plus associated `pytest` tests.
    - Automated branch resets after release. (`.github/workflows/reset-branches.yml`)
        - Automatically resets `dev` and `ci-test` branches to `main` after each release.
        - Automatically resets `stable` to `main` for point releases (when only the 4th version number changes)
- Documentation:
    - Moved release documentation from private internal docs to `docs/developer.md` and updated formatting to match Github requirements.
    - Added thorough CI documentation in `docs/ci.md`.

## Other changes

- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed bug where `DOWNSTREAM` produced no output for groups without vertebrate-viral hits; now produces empty files with appropriate group names.
    - Fixed quote-handling bug causing `DOWNSTREAM` to fail if ONT FASTQ quality scores contain quote characters.
- Added similarity-based duplicate marking tool in `post-processing/`:
    - New Rust tool (`rust_dedup/`) for similarity-based duplicate detection to supplement alignment-based deduplication
    - Uses nao-dedup library (added as git submodule in `post-processing/deps/nao_dedup/`)
- Added issue auto-labeling for Linear integration. (`.github/workflows/label-issues.yml`)

# v3.0.1.7
- Clarified testing documentation in `docs/developer.md`.
- Added bin/clean-nf-test.sh for test cleanup.
- Added sorting of ONT hits by seq_id in `DOWNSTREAM` workflow.

# v3.0.1.6
- Modified filterTsvColumnByValue to correctly handle quotation characters in FASTQ quality strings.
- Modified Github Actions configuration to use the official Github Action to install nf-test.

# v3.0.1.5
- Fixed `SPLIT_VIRAL_TSV_BY_SELECTED_TAXID` failing when input TSV has no data rows. Empty partition files (`partition_empty_*`) are now filtered out before downstream processing. (#524)
- Converted many nf-test tests to Pytest to ease pre-release review.

# v3.0.1.4
- Removed `nextflow.preview.output` statement from `main.nf` for compatibility with Nextflow 25.10
- Updated Github Actions to use Nextflow 25.10.0.
- Updated container and dependency management
    - Implemented container dependency scanning with Trivy (`bin/scan_containers.py`) and wrote corresponding Github Actions test (currently expected to fail).
    - Implemented programmatic generation of Wave containers from YAML configuration files (`bin/build_wave_container.py` and `bin/build_wave_containers.py`) and replaced Docker Hub containers with generated Wave Containers.
    - Deleted obsolete container specifications in `docker` directory.
    - Updated non-results-affecting software versions to reduce vulnerabilities.
- Enabled ONT support for `DOWNSTREAM` post-hoc validation (`VALIDATE_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENTS`).
- Fixed broken documentation links in `docs/run.md`, `docs/virus_hits_final.md`, and `docs/README.md` that were using incorrect relative paths (e.g., `docs/lca.md` instead of `./lca.md`), causing 404 errors on GitHub (#506)
- Fixed typo in `docs/run.md` ("time and and compute" → "time and compute") (#506)
- Updated maintainer references in `docs/developer.md` to reflect current team members (#506)

# v3.0.1.3
- Updated `docs/batch.md` with a deprecation warning linking to private internal infrastructure for SecureBio users.
- Refactored `VALIDATE_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENT` in `DOWNSTREAM` to iterate through clusters within groups, reducing channel elements from N_groups × N_clusters to N_groups (#477)
  - Updated modules to run loops internally rather than having Nextflow iterate through individual elements
  - Created new processes with `_LIST` suffix for backwards compatibility, with tests in `main_list.nf.test` files
  - Removed `CONCATENATE_FILES_ACROSS_SELECTED_TAXID` and `CONCATENATE_TSVS_ACROSS_SELECTED_TAXID` subworkflows which were reduced to single modules by this refactoring

# v3.0.1.2
- `INDEX` workflow now uses daily releases of Virus-Host DB and NCBI taxonomy database, and the Kraken DB was updated to the latest version. (#445)
- Updated virus exclusion list (`ref/hv_patterns_exclude.txt`) used by `INDEX` workflow to exclude additional viruses that were causing false positives. (#445)
- Fixed `FILTER_VIRAL_SAM` handling of multiple secondary alignments for CP/DP pairs with identical grouping keys (reference genome, mate reference genome, position range, template length, alignment scores) - now selects first forward/reverse alignment pair. (#447)
- Fixed `VALIDATE_GROUPING` to include header in the output file that indicates samples with no viral hits. (#449)
- Added Python development dependencies to `pyproject.toml` for easier testing and linting setup. (#451)
- Updated developer docs with Python environment setup instructions using uv. (#451)
- Updated `bin/test_component_dependencies.py` to test subcomponents of a component by default. Only applicable if the component is a workflow/subworkflow. (#291)

# v3.0.1.1
- Added bugfix for `VALIDATE_GROUPING` which allows viral hits tables to have samples that are not found in the groupings file. This previously raised an error, causing `DOWNSTREAM` to not run.
- Updated developer docs (`docs/developer.md`) to reflect new norms and best practices:
    - Updated our branch naming convention.
    - Updated our PR process.
    - Updated our release process.
    - Added preference for using pytest over nf-test for Python unit tests.
- Added `pyproject.toml` to the top level directory to standardize our Python file formatting and type checking rules.

# v3.0.1.0

### Key changes (impacting most users)
- Improved database handling: added caching of large reference files to reduce AWS Batch loading times.
    - Processes on the same compute node can now share Kraken2 and BLAST databases, as well as Minimap2 and Bowtie2 indexes.
    - This reduces pipeline runtime and cost, particularly for workloads with many small `.fastq` files.
    - Core logic implemented in `bin/download-db.sh`.
- Testing changes: Running `nf-test` tests now requires exporting AWS credentials (see `docs/developer.md`).
- Stability improvements:
    - Fixed frequent out-of-memory errors in PROCESS_VIRAL_MINIMAP2_SAM by adjusting resource requirements.
    - Fixed issue where the DOWNSTREAM workflow failed on samples with no viral hits.
    - Fixed bug in ANNOTATE_VIRUS_INFECTION that incorrectly assigned certain viruses to specific hosts (e.g. porcine respiratory coronavirus mislabeled as human-infecting; resolves issue #311).

### Other changes (relevant mainly to developers)
- Bug fixes:
    - RAISE_TAXONOMY_RANKS: Adjusted for updated classification of "Viruses" taxon in NCBI taxonomy database.
    - FILTER_VIRAL_SAM: Now correctly handles concordant pairs with identical positions but differing alignment scores.
    - VALIDATE_GROUPING: Fixed output file name collisions.
    - nf-test file FILTER_VIRAL_SAM: Fixed invalid test inputs.
    - nf-test files for LOAD_SAMPLESHEET and LOAD_DOWNSTREAM_DATE: Fixed line iteration bug.
- Container updates:
    - Introduced new custom containers to support reference file caching (new Dockerfiles in `docker` directory)
    - Added `bin/build-push-docker.sh` to build and push Docker images to Dockerhub.
- Code quality:
    - Converted modules and subworkflows with >5 positional arguments to use parameter maps (reduces risk of argument errors).
    - Added more unit tests in the pytest file for ANNOTATE_VIRUS_INFECTION.
    - Updated Github Actions to retry downloading `nf-test` (it often fails on the first attempt due transient 403 errors).

# v3.0.0.1
- Added bugfix for `RAISE_TAXONOMY_RANKS` to account for change in classification of "Viruses" taxon in NCBI taxonomy database.

# v3.0.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Changed `RUN` workflow viral taxonomic assignment from Kraken2 + aligner ensemble to aligner-only with multiple alignments + LCA algorithm:
    - Replaces `virus_hits_all.tsv.gz` with two new intermediate files: `aligner_hits_all.tsv.gz` (all viral alignments) and `lca_hits_all.tsv.gz` (LCA-processed reads)
    - Updates `virus_hits_final.tsv.gz` columns: removes Kraken2 columns, adds `aligner_` prefix columns for LCA assignments and `prim_align_` prefix columns for primary alignment details
    - Integrates EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT_LCA functionality directly into EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT (similarly for ONT)
    - No changes to input files or parameters required
- Removed `trace.txt` from expected pipeline outputs (as we have changed the trace filename to include a timestamp)

### Other changes

- Added clade counting to DOWNSTREAM. Added a module COUNT_READS_PER_CLADE, which counts the number of LCA-assigned reads in each viral clade. This module:
    - creates a new clade count output file `results_downstream/{sample}_clade_counts.tsv.gz`
    - does not modify any existing output.
    - is called directly in the DOWNSTREAM workflow. If we need more modules for clade counting in the future, will create a subworkflow.
- Updated EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT and EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_ONT for DOWNSTREAM compatibility:
    - Adds primary/secondary/supplementary alignment status tracking to enable duplicate marking in DOWNSTREAM
    - Creates PROCESS_LCA_ALIGNER_OUTPUT subworkflow to merge alignment information with LCA output
    - Ensures `virus_hits_final.tsv.gz` contains necessary columns for downstream duplicate analysis
- Updated DOWNSTREAM to handle LCA assignments above species level for BLAST validation:
    - Previously grouped reads by species taxid for BLAST validation, but LCA can assign reads to genus/family/higher ranks
    - Now groups reads by species taxid assignment if below species level, or by LCA taxid assignment if above species level
    - Renamed processes from "_SPECIES" to "_SELECTED_TAXID" to reflect this broader taxonomic grouping
    - Also updated RUN_VALIDATION to accept the new LCA output format
- Updated SORT_FASTQ to sort alphanumerically
- Updated documentation for LCA integration:
    - Added `docs/lca.md` explaining the LCA algorithm and how it assigns taxonomic IDs to reads with multiple viral alignments
    - Added `docs/lca_intermediates.md` documenting the columns in new intermediate files (`aligner_hits_all.tsv.gz` and `lca_hits_all.tsv.gz`)
    - Updated `docs/run.md` and `docs/virus_hits_final.md` with new column descriptions and workflow changes

# v2.10.0.1
- Removed extremely long reads (>500000bp) before FASTQC on ONT data, and upped memory resources for FASTQC, to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- Made separate run_illumina.config and run_ont.config files to record correct BLAST defaults for each.

# v2.10.0.0
- Moved all outputs to main workflow for compatibility with Nextflow 25.04, and made pipeline compliant with new strict syntax.
    - Pipeline is now *incompatible* with Nextflow 24.
- Changed column names in `virus_hits_final.tsv` for consistency between Illumina and ONT output:
    - Added `docs/virus_hits_final.md` with full documentation of column names.
    - Column prefixes `bowtie2_` and `minimap2_` changed to `aligner_`.
    - Removed columns `bowtie2_fragment_length_fwd/rev`, `minimap2_query_sequence`, `minimap2_read_length`, `minimap2_ref_start/end`, `minimap2_alignment_start/end`.
    - Added boolean columns `query_rc_by_aligner` and `query_rc_by_aligner_rev` to keep track of when the aligner reverse-complements a read; updated `query_seq` to undo the reverse complement operation.
    - Changed column prefixes from `kraken_` to `kraken2_`.
- Made more processes compatible with ONT/other unpaired data:
    - `run_validation` workflow now runs on ONT/other unpaired data.
    - Updated EXTRACT_VIRAL_HITS_TO_FASTQ_NOREF_LABELED to infer endedness based on the input file and to work correctly on both unpaired and paired-end data.
    - Updated BOWTIE2 and PROCESS_VIRAL_BOWTIE2_SAM to handle unpaired input data.
- Overhauled MARK_ALIGNMENT_DUPLICATES:
    - Increased computational efficiency:
        - Added multithreaded processing of easily parallelizable steps.
        - Reworked assignment of reads to duplicate groups to avoid slow all-vs-all comparisons.
    - Made MARK_ALIGNMENT_DUPLICATES explicitly handle NAs:
        - Now if the forward reads match and the reverse read alignments are NA, reads will be marked as duplicates. This is more conservative than the previous approach, which excluded reads from duplicate groups if either alignment was NA.
- Completed work on post-hoc validation and integrated into DOWNSTREAM workflow:
    - Updated VALIDATE_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENTS to concatenate across species before rather than after BLAST_VIRAL, dramatically reducing per-process fixed costs of running BLAST. (Involved updates to PROPAGATE_VALIDATION_INFORMATION as well as new CONCATENATE_FASTA_ACROSS_SPECIES subworkflow and CONCATENATE_FASTN_LABELED process.)
    - Updated COMPUTE_TAXID_DISTANCE to compute distance from each taxid to their LCA rather than a single relative distance.
    - Modified COMPUTE_TAXID_DISTANCE and VALIDATE_CLUSTER_REPRESENTATIVES to use parameter maps.
    - Added VALIDATE_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENTS to the DOWNSTREAM workflow and wrote associated tests.
- Preparatory work for implementing LCA (lowest common ancestor) analysis:
    - Added FILTER_VIRAL_SAM process for consolidated preprocessing of viral alignments before converting to a TSV to run LCA on.
    - Created new temporary workflow EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT_LCA, that will eventually replace EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT. In this workflow:
        - Changed Bowtie2 to run with multiple alignments.
        - Conducted contaminant and score filtering of Bowtie2 reads before running LCA.
        - Removed the TAXONOMY subworkflow (effectively removing our usage of Kraken2 in identifying viral reads).
        - Updated EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS_SHORT_LCA such that the output viral hits table is compatible with the DOWNSTREAM workflow
- Other updates:
    - Added developer documentation (docs/developer.md).
    - Switched to a defined release from [VirusHostDB](https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb), as the previous link (https://www.genome.jp/virushostdb/virushostdb.tsv) is currently broken.
    - Made trace files generated by Nextflow for RUN and DOWNSTREAM unique across runs by adding timestamps to the filenames (prevents overwriting when running multiple attempts in the same directory).

# v2.9.0.4
- Updated markAlignmentDuplicates module to reduce memory overhead and increase memory allocation (which collectively should avoid out-of-memory errors in DOWNSTREAM on large read groups).

# v2.9.0.3
- Make sure field per_tile_sequence_quality is always present in multiqc output summary file, to allow pipeline to run successfully on a mix of empty and non-empty files
- Add set -eou pipefail to all ONT processes with pipes; make MASK_FASTQ_READS robust to empty files; add empty file tests for MASK_FASTQ_READS and MINIMAP2

# v2.9.0.2

    - Implemented VALIDATE_CLUSTER_REPRESENTATIVES subworkflow for comparing Bowtie2 and BLAST-LCA assignments, including new SELECT_TSV_COLUMNS and COMPUTE_TAXID_DISTANCE processes
    - Implemented PROPAGATE_VALIDATION_INFORMATION subworkflow to merge cluster-representative validation information back into raw hits TSV
    - Implemented CHECK_TSV_DUPLICATES process and added to SPLIT_VIRAL_TSV_BY_SPECIES to prevent many-to-many joins during post-hoc validation
    - Implemented CONCATENATE_TSVS_ACROSS_SPECIES subworkflow for reconstructing grouped viral hits TSV from species-specific TSVs
- Modified SORT_TSV behavior to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- Updated trace path for DOWNSTREAM workflow to avoid overwriting RUN workflow trace.

    - Implemented basic algorithm for computing the lowest common ancestor of sets of taxids in tabular TSV data (LCA_TSV), including special handling of artificial and unclassified taxids
    - Integrated LCA_TSV into BLAST_FASTA subworkflow and updated tests

# v2.9.0.0
- Implemented ONT analysis in the RUN workflow
    - Combined run_dev_se.nf with run.nf
    - Renamed `hits_filtered` outputs of short-read workflow and `hits_hv` outputs of ONT workflow to `hits_final` for consistency across platforms

    - Added end-to-end tests for ONT to github actions
- Prepared DOWNSTREAM workflow for running with internal mgs-orchestrator repo
    - Added `expected-outputs-downstream.txt` file containing list of expected output files for the DOWNSTREAM workflow
    - Modified output paths for non-results DOWNSTREAM outputs to avoid overwriting RUN outputs
    - Changed strict-join of hits and grouping TSVs across sample names to inner-join (to drop samples that are not present in both TSVs)
- Began development of post-hoc validation of putative viral hits in the DOWNSTREAM workflow
    - Split viral hits TSV by assigned species and extract read sequences (SPLIT_VIRAL_TSV_BY_SPECIES)
    - Cluster within species with VSEARCH and obtain representative sequences (CLUSTER_VIRAL_ASSIGNMENTS)
    - Split out merge/join part of TAXONOMY workflow into its own subworkflow (MERGE_JOIN_READS) that can be used by both TAXONOMY and post-hoc validation (with associated tests)
- Added a development_mode parameter to LOAD_SAMPLESHEET to allow testing on non-implemented platform/endedness
- Get rid of lingering references to human viruses/HV in comments, variable names, etc.
- Updated SUBSET_FASTQ to handle plaintext and FASTA input (and renamed to SUBSET_FASTN)
- Modified various RUN workflow components to correctly handle empty input files (which previously caused failures).
- Added `test_component_dependencies.py` script to test all modules, subworkflows, and workflows that depend on a given component (e.g., BBDUK, or TAXONOMY)

# v2.8.3.2
- Modified FASTQ_LABELED to use fixed cpus and memory, and added `--memory` parameter to make full use of available memory.

- Added new LOAD_SAMPLESHEET subworkflow to centralize samplesheet processing
- Updated tags to prevent inappropriate S3 auto-cleanup
- Testing infrastructure
  - Split up the tests in `End-to-end MGS workflow test` so that they can be run in parallel on Github Actions.
  - Implemented an end-to-end test that checks if the RUN workflow produces the correct output.

# v2.5.0
- Reintroduced user-specified sample grouping and concatenation (e.g. across sequencing lanes) for deduplication in PROFILE and EXTRACT_VIRAL_READS.
- Generalised pipeline to detect viruses infecting arbitrary host taxa (not just human-infecting viruses) as specified by `ref/host-taxa.tsv` and config parameters.
- Configured index workflow to enable hard-exclusion of specific virus taxa (primarily phages) from being marked as infecting ost taxa of interest.
- Updated pipeline output code to match changes made in latest Nextflow update (24.10.0).
- Created a new script `bin/analyze-pipeline.py` to analyze pipeline structure and identify unused workflows and modules.

# v2.4.0
- Created a new output directory where we put log files called `logging`.
- Added the trace file from Nextflow to the `logging` directory which can be used for understanding cpu, memory usage, and other infromation like runtime. After running the pipeline, `plot-timeline-script.R` can be used to generate a useful summary plot of the runtime for each process in the pipeline.
- Removed CONCAT_GZIPPED.
- Replaced the sample input format with something more similar to nf-core, called `samplesheet.csv`. This new input file can be generated using the script `generate_samplesheet.sh`.
- Now run deduplication on paired-ends reads using clumpify in the taxonomic workflow.
- Fragment length analysis and deduplication analysis.
  - BBtools: Extract the fragment length as well as the number of duplicates from the taxonomic workflow and add them to the `hv_hits_putative_collapsed.tsv.gz`.
  - Bowtie2: Conduct a duplication analysis on the aligned reads, then add the number of duplicates and fragment length to the `hv_hits_putative_collapsed.tsv.gz`.
